Everyone loved playing with the lil\\' tokens.  Call me crazy... but I think the game is just more fun when you are using a miniature sheep for a sheep, a miniature wood for a wood, etc... instead of plain ole cards.  It was easy.  We each kept our pieces in a small non-see-through cup during play (you can also play with your resources visible to all).  Not to mention... they were just a fraction of the price of the replacement deck I was going to buy online!  We are very happy with our purchase.  :)\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"For the price, then game is awesome for a 3 year-old! Mine LOVES it. Be prepared to want to shoot yourself in the head after playing it for the umpteenth time in a row, but fun enough to entertain a preschooler (though would get boring pretty fast for an older child). Gameplay is simple enough to allow for young kiddos to play independently of an adult (if that is an option for you!) For like the $5-6 I paid for it, the game is interchangeable for just cheap but pretty sturdy pirate toys (even recycle the sword into a safe, lightweight Halloween costume accessory), so worth the price on that note alone. On the one hand, I love that the map (which you can\\'t really see in the picture) is also a bag to hold the game, but would\\'ve preferred that the game packaging was reusable as a box as the map gets &#34;deformed&#34; by stuffing all the pieces in it and becomes somewhat of a pain to use as the flat playing surface necessary for the game (especially if you are not interested in pulling the little plastic stands off the treasure pieces every time which I imagine would also decrease the life of the pieces). This is of course easily solved by say putting it all in a gallon or bigger sized ziplock, or another box you have around, especially if you\\'d like it to stack nicely with your other games, but since I had to chuck all the packaging, would have been less wasteful if it was reusable. Overall, a fun and inexpensive game for the younger set which can be made super simple or a bit more challenging depending on how serious you are about hiding the treasure, and fun game/pirate-play pieces (just don\\'t lose them!).\"\\n',\n",

It doesn\\'t come with batteries so you\\'ll need 4 AA batteries if you don\\'t have them. The toy worked exactly as it said,  the helicopter launched from the truck and flew. The helicopter is the main toy here, the truck is just a bonus really. It\\'s cool though.

I do not own or collect shopkins, but I have been looking for an organizer that is small and compact that I can use for my jewelry when traveling.

       " '\"This toy is a knock-it-out-of-the-park hit.  Sure, the toy is, as one reviewer noted, &#34;limited play.&#34;  The &#34;limited&#34; part is that it does five things, and requires a ton of room, like a family room or a really big outdoor area.  Blaze does not work well on carpeting.  Though Blaze &#34;only&#34; does five things, periodically you get cued to give Blaze a hand, like filling his tires or revving his engine.<br /><br />Blaze is surprisingly heavy, but the weight is needed to help Blaze do his multiple stunts.  A lever automatically lowers to help Blaze do his various stunts.  Technically, Blaze only does five things, four of which are stunts, but Blaze seems to do a bit of ad-libbing from time to time that makes the five stunts seem like a lot more.  Blaze lifts up from the back, from the front, from the side, and does tail spins.  Blaze also talks and provides his own music.  Admittedly, the talking and music can get a little old, but it is so amusing to watch Blaze do tricks that we had little time to be bored.<br /><br />The only &#34;down side&#34; to Blaze is that Blaze requires a LOT of area without carpeting to do his stunts.  Blaze does have a power mode that works okay on carpet, but any stunts that use the automatic lever work much better on a relatively smooth surface, like a concrete or hardwood floor.<br /><br />We have had many different toy vehicles over the decades, some of which were nearly the cost of this vehicle.  Many of those vehicles only did one thing.  Occasionally they might do something else, like pop a wheelie.  But none of those vehicles would do all the things this vehicle will do.

It even comes with one.  So if you are like me, and prefer the feel of an octagonal restrictor gate, there\\'s going to be a learning curve.  When you switch gates like that, you end up losing roughly half of the diagonal sensitivity, because of the way the microswitches are placed.  So while you have a smoother overall motion, you need to be very deliberate in hitting all of the directions.<br /><br />Now this isn\\'t a knock against the joystick, even though it may seem like it.  This is more of a warning to anyone who might be thinking of switching the gate out.  And even then, the replacement gates are pretty cheap, and take about 20 seconds to install.  I\\'m still quite happy I put one of these in my arcade stick, because they feel great to use, and it contrasts well with my black case.<br /><br />So as far as I\\'m concerned, this is the best joystick I\\'ve used.  Just maybe do some research if you want to swap out restrictor gates on it.\"\\n',\n",

I was so excited when my daughter got this for her daughter - as I have many fond memories of both of my children playing with their cozy coup\\'s when they were toddlers.  The design hasn\\'t changed a lot in the over 25 years since my kids had these - I guess if something isn\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it.  One nice feature about the newer models is they are taller and I am able to push my 18 month old granddaughter in her &#34;car&#34; without it breaking my back.  I am only 5\\'5&#34; and I think anyone much taller then me would have to bend though.<br /><br />I put the coup together and used the on-line video instruction and it made the job very easy.  I did it by myself and had no issues.  I am a visual person so this was much better than the instruction manual.  Following the video step-by-step will assure you don\\'t put anything together bassackwards .... you do not want to try and take this baby apart believe me.  After I put it together we took it for a few spins in the house on the hardwood floors and one of the front wheels did not operate properly - it was kind of &#34;frozen&#34; and wouldn\\'t swivel like it should.  I called Little Tikes and their rep was very friendly and helpful.  Once we took it outside on the concrete it worked perfectly.  Couldn\\'t get the necessary traction inside (probably not an ideal inside toy anyway but with grandparents, we have a whole different set of rules than we did for our own kids lol!) .<br /><br />Get one of these for your kids or grandkids - they will love it - and so will you.\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"Iron Maiden has always featured Eddie &#34;The Head&#34; on all of their album artwork, as well as in their stage performances. This particular Eddie is represented on the album Piece of Mind.<br /><br />I\\'ve never owned one of the new NECA mego styled figures, so I had no idea what to expect. I\\'m glad I got this one, he is quite an awesome figure.<br /><br />The sculpt of his head is a dead on representation of the album artwork, and the face is scary as it should be. Every detail was paid attention too, down to the tiny screws holding the plate that holds his head together. This is one of the best head sculpts I have ever seen on an action figure. The feet are sculpted equally grotesque, and they look appropriately Eddie. From the knee up, however, he is a plain, flesh toned &#34;buck&#34; body. His collar around his neck is very well sculpted as well, straight down to the tiny little lock that looks as though it holds it shut. It even features real metal chains attached to it.<br /><br />Paint on Eddie is fantastic. The face is so detailed that Eddie appears to have crawled right out of the album artwork. His teeth, tongue, eyes, and even the bit of blood dripping from his skull cap are expertly applied. The only thing that costs this figure points on paint is that NECA have decided to &#34;shade&#34; the head and collar like on the album artwork, and not on the clothes, so he looks to be half shaded. Even with the jarring paint shading on his head and collar, he is still an amazing portrayal of Eddie.<br /><br />The cloth clothes are very nice, in my opinion. His jeans are appropriately ripped and have been &#34;stained&#34; to appear dirty. The straightjacket is amazing, and has lots of straps on the back as it should. Both the pants and straightjacket have Velcro on them, and while the pants are easily removed, I can not see any way to take the straightjacket off without damaging it. Looks like Eddie is permanently restrained.<br /><br />The articulation on Eddie is pretty good too. He has a double ball jointed head/neck that allows a nice range of motion, though it is a little tight. His legs have hinged hips, swivel thighs, hinged knees, and hinged ankles. The legs allow a nice range of motion, however it does feel slightly limited due to the cloth jeans. The upper body has a waist swivel, and the arms are as articulated as the legs. The straightjacket however prevents most motion though, and while his arms are slightly movable, they will never have the range of articulation that other figures have.<br /><br />Overall, this NECA mego styled Eddie, from the classic Iron Maiden album Piece of Mind, is a must have for fans of the band and these NECA figures. Highly reccomended.\"\\n',\n",

The arrows are tipped with soft, collapsible rubber, so they are quite safe (they also whistle as they fly).

(For some reason, the newer AMT Round 2 model of this kit isn\\'t available at all anywhere that I could find.) Last week, when I saw it was down to $24.99, I knew I couldn\\'t pass that up. Package arrived mint-in-box, and, even though one corner was a little crumpled, everything inside was still wrapped and in new condition. I was extremely pleased with how well the pieces of this kit went together. With the other kits from 20+ years ago, I\\'d always had trouble with some pieces not fitting correctly due to age and/or warping. But I got lucky with this one. Everything fit and glued together just like it was supposed to. And, as usual, I went with my own color scheme. It looks great sitting on my shelf next to the battlecruiser from Star Trek VI.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I purchased a second kit, and I decided to try a different color scheme. (Plus, I think I like the attack mode wing configuration better than the flight mode.) Although I\\'m still not sure I chose the right shade of green for the ship\\'s hull, I definitely like the second color scheme better than the first.\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"This set is a departure from the LEGO bricks, and with this set you are only building vehicles.<br /><br />I felt like the directions (color booklet) were easy to follow for an adult or a teen, but for a younger kid it just is too challenging.  However you don\\'t have to be limited to the directions, you can make any sort of free form vehicle you want.  It\\'s nice though, to have the guide in case you need a little bit of guidance.<br /><br />Pieces are sturdy and are not going to break on you.  Most of the &#34;joint&#34; pieces are yellow with a few black and orange ones thrown in.  Set comes with a set of wheels (tank style), one drill attachment, one construction type man with a hat, and a pod for the man to fit in so he can drive.  There are enough pieces to make a very elaborate vehicle.<br /><br />You can buy other sets and combine them together, and I suspect if your child is a fan of these that is what will have to happen.  The box says ages 6 and up, but I\\'d say the ideal age would be 8 and up, because by that age they can read and follow the directions without adult help.\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"A truly wonderful collector item.<br /><br />I was at first a bit disappointed when I noticed that it is not the original RX78 from the first Gundam series, but then got used to the new design.<br /><br />There are a ton of parts; it is impressive how many small little parts are included with this figure; this is because there are 3 different variations that you can make; which involve swapping parts from the arms, legs, shoulder and chest pieces. The changes are minimal; so you will just end up picking the parts that you like and leave the figure as is. The only noticeable change is some chrome parts, which are nice, althought they do not fit really well the anime version.<br /><br />The figure itself is a bargain; it is mostly made of metal, and I was surprised to see how nice it is, considering that other gundam models from the same line, cost 100 dollars more. I thought it was defective or had issues, but this figure exceed my expectations.<br />I build Gunpla, and I like them, although with time, the joints become loose and the plastic brittle, so I decided to replace my favorite figures with more durable version. This is not as fun as to build a gunpla, but the superior durability is a great plus.<br /><br />The articulations are really solid and heavy; all major joints are in metal; and posing the figure is a pleasure, since it moves fluidly, without feel too stiff or too loose. good range of motion, kneeling is perfect, and you won\\'t have issues to put the figure in any pose you like.<br /><br />The negatives are few: the first is the head movement that is somehow limited when using the shoulder cannon. The cannon itself is fixed and the articulation is plastic; which is prone to be snapped or get bad with time; not sure why Bandai didn\\'t go the extra mile to make this figure great.<br />Another downside of the figure is the shield: it fall apart as soon as you touch it, and checking on variouos forums, it seems that most of the collectors simply superglue the various parts of the shield, so it won\\'t fall apart when posing the figure. The handle itself is great, snaps nicely, but the part where the handle goes on (and hold basically the shield to the forearm), just snap off as soon as you breathe on it; same goes for the saber holder and the extra rifle holder. Just a dab of glue and the shield will stay solid, when connected to the forearm; nothing that would damage the value of the figure.<br /><br />The gundam opens too; and can hold inside a core fighter; which is a small foldable airplane. in the main show; the cool part was the little jet folding and connecting with torso and legs to create different setup, making it a modular robot; so you can recreate the feel of the original anime if you like. There is also a plastic piece that holds the torso and legs together; in case you want to display the core fighter on its own (once it is inside the gundam, there is no way to actually see it); I keep it outside also because I do not want to separate the figure and eventually scratch the paint.<br /><br />Overall, buy it now if you are a fan of Gundam, but also as action figure, it is a great purchase, even if you never heard of Gundam.he various parts of the shield, so it won\\'t fall apart when posing the figure.

It would have been nice to have the coins arranged in chronological order on the front as well, but thanks to the well written descriptions it would be hard to mistake the coins for one another anyways.<br /><br />Each coin is fastened to the card stock display via glue, and then enveloped in a thick clear plastic sleeve making it easy to keep the display in good condition if you keep the coins attached.  The display card itself shows an impressive amount of organization for the informative text, and the images are both crisp and well placed.  The sheen of the coins are beautiful, the gold ones in particular seem to shine no matter how little light their exposed to.<br />All in all a very worthwhile purchase for any Egyptian history enthusiast.\"\\n',\n",

This enhances the randomness of rolls, in my opinion.  The other nice feature I like is that the numbers (pips) are all below-counter sunk.

This seemed like a logical extension, especially since her mother loves the Xbox games.  She was over the moon to get this game, and that\\'s with it in the box.<br /><br />For the first time with a console game, she can play it.  By herself.  That\\'s a big deal when you are the shortest member of the family, it seems.  The games are engaging, although she is quickly forming favorites within the selection.  (She  is apparently falling in love with Olaf.)  Since she already recognizes numbers, the game is within her grasp without undue effort.  Learning to operate the console and controller was a bit of a challenge at first, but the young princess of cell phones, tablets, and remotes soon mastered THAT too.<br /><br />The games are educational, which satisfies her parents and grandparents as to their merit and justifies their expense.  She loves the graphics, and isn\\'t overly critical about their quality.  At 4, she\\'s also not a literary critic, so cheesy storylines don\\'t faze her at all.  This isn\\'t a game designed for adults or teens--it\\'s designed for the pre-school to primary age group.<br /><br />The game enthralls her now.  How long the game will continue to do so is still an unknown.  Typically, if it follows the pattern with games she has played on our Kindles, she will use it for 6-9 months, then outgrow it.  If she masters all of the skills it is attempting to teach, it will have delivered more than our money\\'s worth.  If she has enough fun to even get her to master half of those skills, the same thing is true.<br /><br />The bottom line is that if she is happy, we\\'re all happy.  If she\\'s happy and learning too, we\\'re ecstatic.  I really don\\'t see any negatives to this game.\"\\n',\n",

The figures arrived on time and in perfect condition. They are all highly posable and come with a large variety of accessories to equip them with, so be sure to have a place to store the extra pieces (I used tupperware).  The only piece I had a hard time with was getting the wings to stick on regular Gurren Lagann, but after a minute or two of tweaking, I got them to stay pretty well. One other warning, some of the pieces are quite difficult to exchange (they can be a pretty tight fit), so just be careful when posing them.  Overall, this was an excellent purchase and saved me a ton of money. They\\'re the real deal.  UPDATE: (3/25/16) The crescent-moon type yellow ornament on regular Gurren Lagann\\'s head broke off. It seems a little fragile, so I\\'d recommend handling with care. I was able to easily super-glue it back on without noticeable signs of breakage.

But THIS little guy is different.  This thing is everything you\\'d think it would be plus a little.  I\\'m still getting used to it but I was up and zooming around my house within about 45 seconds.  I was actually chasing my kids around within about 5 minutes.  It\\'s SO easy to learn and super intuitive.<br /><br />The only issue I\\'ve had so far is that when I get going pretty fast (this is outside... not inside) it feels like each side of the device starts to wobble - almost as if I\\'m telling it to turn ever so slightly but alternating back and forth with each foot.  I\\'m guessing this is just do to my body trying to maintain balance as the device speeds up and I\\'m sure I\\'ll get used to it over time.  But I can VERY comfortably zoom around and 3mph or so.<br /><br />My wife, my very patient wife, gave me the typical light hearted eye roll when I told her I ordered one of these.  But she couldn\\'t help but say that it looked really cool and fun once I started playing with it.  She\\'s 21 weeks pregnant at the moment so I don\\'t think it\\'s wise for her to try it out at this point but she totally wants to.<br /><br />So far the battery life seems impressive.  I rode it for a solid 45 minutes or so and the battery indicator was still solid green.  I\\'m guessing that it will eventually change to orange or yellow when it\\'s getting low and then flash red once it\\'s close to dying.<br /><br />Some have mentioned that it\\'s difficult to mount.  And I had this issue at first too.  It seems to want to turn in constant circles while you\\'re mounting it.  BUT - I\\'ve found if you rotate the platform to be level (do this by putting one foot on the device and keeping your other off and pressing forward and back with your foot until it\\'s level) it will beep and then remain still while you mount it.  So for those having this issue, try that method and see if it helps.<br /><br />In summary - I love the thing.  I can\\'t wait to see how these develop/evolve over the next year or two.\"\\n',\n",

I haven\\'t tried putting the umbrella on yet (it currently lives in our carport), but the table is a great height for her and is stable. We originally intended to just use both sides as a water table, fearing the potential mess, but I think we will be getting some sand for one side eventually. It has a decent height divider between the two sides, so maybe the mess won\\'t be too great. My only complaint really is that the table slowly leaks water out, even on the side intended for water (it\\'s a much faster leak on the side intended for sand). Not a huge deal for us, as the table is outside, but if you\\'re utilizing the table inside, you might want to caulk where the legs come up into the table to prevent leakage. The lid stays on well when secured with the bungee cords on each end. Came with 2 little pails with holes in the bottom (about 3 or so inches tall), 2 little boats, and a small shovel. Wonderful purchase, would definitely recommend it.\"\\n',\n",

The kit includes a plastic container that can be filled with water with a lid that can act as a diving platform.<br /><br />While on solid ground it will move with its fins and waddle across a surface. Once it gets in water a small propeller built into its hind quarters will push it along while the fins continue to move. The turtle appears to be pretty buoyant and will keep itself on the surface of the water.

If your kids haven\\'t seen the movie or didn\\'t get into the movie, they\\'re going to find limited value --- because to me the value of the toy is in kids between 6 - 9 role playing some of the scenes and for that you need a few emotion characters.\"\\n',\n",

There are a lot of parts so I recommend getting some sort of storage system to keep them all sorted. The structure beams are very sturdy, and not nearly as bendy as LEGO EV3. Speaking of EV3, I LOVE that the VEX IQ brain has 12 ports. Three times as many as LEGO. The display on the brain is very easy to read, and very responsive as well. A couple minor downsides: There were a lot of plastic bags with various parts included in the kit, so it took awhile to unpack everything. Not a problem with the system at all, just took a little time to sort everything.  While it got much easier over time, the resistance of putting some shaft collars could be difficult. Nonetheless, after spending just a day with the VEX IQ kit, I already prefer it over EV3, and would recommend it to anybody with children interested in robotics (I\\'ve got a 14 year old and an 11 year old, and they love it).  The parts are easy to build with, and very reasonably priced. I see a lot of room for expansion, and am excited to see what VEX IQ comes out with next.\"\\n',\n",

The figure is actually much better than I expected.<br /><br />I would\\'ve rather had the version that is pale and in a white bikini, however that one goes for more than twice the cost of this already expensive figure. I am glad, however, that I chose this one.<br /><br />Sonico is wearing very minimal clothing, and for as skimpy as the outfit is, the articulation doesn\\'t stand out nearly as much as I thought it would. All the joints are nice, move very fluidly, and blend in well. The torso joint especially is nicely hidden under her breasts, so you really can\\'t see it head on. My one minor nitpick with the articulation is that the hands have a visible joint, however the very nice articulation those joints provide outweighs the aesthetics. This figure is so well articulated, you can pretty much pose her any way a human can pose. The included figure stand assists well in getting her into action poses.<br /><br />Paint on this figure is very well done. The skin tone is perfectly tan, and appears slightly shiny, almost as if she\\'s been soaking in the suntan lotion. She has a nice little mark on her left thigh, the logo from her anime, and it is pale and appears like a tanning mark (like the little hearts and things that women use when they get tanned). The mark looks appropriately pale as if it was covered while the rest of her was tanning. The silver on her bikini is very well done, very metallic, and is perfectly applied. Her faces are very well detailed and have small details that look hand painted and are very well executed. Sonico\\'s hair is nicely painted with a light pink to dark pink gradient, and it looks perfect. The accessories are all well painted too.<br /><br />Sonico comes with a total of 7 different hands for posing, a popsicle, a beach ball, and a floaty ring (which I can confirm actually floats!). All of the accessories are perfectly themed for her to have some summer fun. She also includes a figma stand that, as previously mentioned, is very useful in assisting her in action poses.<br /><br />Overall, the Figma EX-023 Super Sonico (suntanned version) is a very good value. It\\'s cute, posable, and a good conversation piece (people on instagram are always asking how they can get one.). Highly reccomended for fans of anime, figma, action figures in general, and girls in bikinis.\"\\n',\n",

And the workmanship is incredible. Nice details, hearts on the feet, the little faces on their costumes are well done.  I can not find a single loose stitch, they\\'re perfect.

       " '\"My 18 month old granddaughter was very excited as soon as we took this out of the box.  She immediately started putting toys on top of &#34;her&#34; table - as obviously this was for her and NOT FOR ANYONE ELSE LOL!<br /><br /> She has had a little difficulty getting onto the chairs properly.  She is 32&#34; tall but her butt level is lower than the chair seat so she tries to &#34;scoot&#34; onto the chair and can only get a small part of her bum onto it.  Then as she tries to &#34;scoot&#34;onto the chair it pushes away from her.  The chairs are very light and even on an area rug move when she tries to get in them.  She has already learned to kind of half sit on the chair and wait for grandma & granddad to lift her the rest of the way onto the chair.  Her feet do not touch the floor when seated but she slides off the chair and hasn\\'t had a problem on the dismount ha ha.  I think another inch or so of growth and the problem will be resolved.<br /><br />My Yorkie also loves the table as when my granddaughter is having lunch or her snack, he is right in feeding range - she does the one bite for you - one bite for the dog eating method - and they both enjoy this immensely.  I was going to try and tell her &#34;don\\'t feed the dog&#34; but she has so much fun doing it I just can\\'t tell her no (I would have never let my kids do this, but grandkids, that is a whole different story).<br /><br />Anyway, this is a nice little table that doesn\\'t take a lot of room and is easy to move inside and outside the house.  Works well as a play surface and can also be used for meals/snacks.  I was going to get a Little Tikes picnic table but decided to try this instead and am glad I did.  Picnic table wouldn\\'t have been nearly as portable and would have taken a lot more space.  The two chairs fit completely under the table when not is use so great for anyone who wants a play table for their toddler with limited space.<br /><br />Thanks.\"\\n',\n",

       " \"[[VIDEOID:e20d26d420fd5088037c6a07305dbf3f]] Techege Toys Fire engine is a pretty neat toy. It has full lights and sounds and even looks like a fire truck. The lights go through out the whole truck and lights in bright multi colors. Even the headlights light up and shine bright in front of it to make it more realistic. The hose on top you can also move around. This fire engine operates off 3 AA batteries which is secure on the bottom of the truck which does need a small screwdriver to open up. That is something I do really like in toys this way little kids can't open it on their own and get to the batteries. There is an on/off switch on the bottom so it's not constantly on. Once you do turn it on it moves and has sound as if it's a real fire truck making it's way to a fire! I do have to admit it is a little loud so I do wish there was a volume control however the sound completes the toy and it wouldn't be the same without it so I wouldn't change it at all. I even had a friend on the phone when my son was playing with it and he thought it was a real fire truck outside my house. I also like that as it's moving if it hits into anything in it's path it will backup and go a different way as many times as needed so you don't need to worry about it hitting into a wall and having to chase after it to turn it around. I am very impressed with this toy. It is high quality and sturdy. I find it very safe for kids to use. Recommended age is 3 and up which I think is perfect. Both my kids actually enjoy it and won't give it up. I feel 100% comfortable recommending this toy to others. I received this for free in exchange for my honest review.

       " '\"This was a fantastic purchase! Bought it over a year ago and it has held together extremely well (solid and built to last). My 4 year old (soon to be 5) and my 2 year old can both ride this very well. I\\'ve also had older kids (that are much too big for it) take it for a ride and it has not warped or broken. The LEAN TO STEER IS A MUST HAVE! The kids picked up the concept right away (before I could even explain it) and it is so much easier for them control than the \\'turn the handle bars\\' design. If you are on the fence about the \\'lean to steer\\' don\\'t be. I\\'ve seen all the kids in my neighborhood use this design with great success (even a 2 year old that rides the scooter like an X games master). Most of the other kids where we live have the Micro Mini, which is the same style scooter as this and looks just as good, but is much more expensive. I went with the Radio Flyer, and not only is it easier to distinguish which scooter is mine at the playground, I am able to buy two of these for the same price as one Micro Mini. Would highly recommend to anyone, even if your child is very small. It took my boys a while of playing with it before they got really good with it, but they had fun the whole time (even before they could really ride it). Fantastic buy! And the kids love it, not to mention the convenience of having my 4 year old be able to keep up with me when walking quickly somewhere, or running errands. Thanks Radio Flyer, we love this scooter!\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"K2 is a slow moving game that requires patience and the ability to balance movement points and acclimatization together. Once you understand all the technicalities of the game, you can then appreciate what\\'s required to do well. Being a race, one might think speed up the mountain is most important.  Wrong!  Keeping your climbers alive while gradually moving up is more important. The tension builds as climbers get closer to the top. I can see how experience at mountain climbing made the production of this game possible. For anyone who\\'s climber gets to the top and is still alive at the end of the game, I say TAKE A BOW! That\\'s how difficult the game is. It doesn\\'t bog down from analysis paralysis, because every player is figuring out their strategy at the same time. It took my group of 3 players one hour to play. We all felt exhausted at the end!  I will say it was fun, enough to give it 5 stars. If your gaming group has a lot of patience, you will enjoy K2. Also, all the mechanics seem to work very well. Before buying this game, make sure you watch a few tutorials, and get a good idea if it\\'s the kind of game you would like.\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"I feel like the first review posted here sells the game short a bit. While it\\'s like Risk in that both games have dice, The Ares Project adds in quite a few other elements to combat. Units are divided into four types (infantry, armor, air, and buildings) and each unit has its own to-hit numbers for each of these unit types as well as special abilities (tough, shielded, deep strike, and others) in addition to positional modifiers, flanking modifiers, and other modifiers from special buildings or attached technologies/powers. It\\'s very possible for a single well-placed force to decimate a larger force if you properly utilize the strengths and weaknesses built into the combat system.  Admittedly the basic rules are fairly simple and omit many of the special powers and buildings that add complexity to the game. However, the developers intended the basic rules to be a tutorial to help players get a grasp on the combat system before graduating to the full rules. Once the full rules are in play, each of the four factions takes on an asymmetrical aspect as each produces units, power, and upgrades differently. Each faction is designed with specific strengths and weaknesses and favors a certain play style.  The flavor of each faction is pretty strong (a force of Space Marines and their vehicles, a cabal of psychic wizards flinging elemental spells and hazards, ever-evolving insectoid Martians, and a gargantuan mecha) and creates a lot of amazing scenarios with a little imagination.  I would NOT describe this game as \\'simple\\'. The rules do have a bit of a learning curve but that\\'s because the game has depth. If you have a dedicated player you can learn the game with, there\\'s a lot of replayability here.  One negative is that the art on the cards is a bit drab and simply shows the production building in an aerial view; images of the units produced by that building would probably have been nicer.  Other than that, this is a well-constructed game that captures the feel of RTS. Itplays best with 2 but has variants for 3 or 4. Be sure you have someone who can dedicate time to learning the game with you and it will be a solid addition to your collection.\"\\n',\n",

My old xacto blade would snap every so often and this is a big money-saver for me in that sense.<br /><br />It does take a little bit of getting used to if you\\'re switching over from the typical xacto (since, again, this blade is weighted at the end) but once you\\'ve been using it for a while it becomes an extension of your hand.

This Harbor Expansion really made it LOTS more fun. I guess the variation we play is not according to the rules (5-5-2), but it offers different options every game. If you accumulate the right combination of properties and get lucky on the roll of the dice, you can rake in lots of money quickly and sweep to a great victory! It is one of our favorites,\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"My Kindergartner loves her new nap mat. Most mats are only 5/8&#34; thick and have a thin mil plastic covering. The thin mil plastic tears easily and generally has to be taped several times to get through the year. This one seems much more durable. We\\'ll see if it can last the year, but from the feel of the plastic, if it doesn\\'t last out the year nothing will.<br /><br />I also love the extra thickness of this mat. I didn\\'t want my little girl to feel like she was sleeping against the floor like you do with those 5/8&#34; mats. The way the measuring works is if it says it is a 1&#34; mat, it is actually only 5/8&#34; of foam. If it advertises 2&#34; like this one, you get 1-1/2&#34; of foam thickness. That makes it pretty much like lumber measurements, so it\\'s good to know before you buy.<br /><br />While this will take up twice the storage space of the thinner mats, it is much higher quality and will provide better support and comfort for your child.<br /><br />Hint, You can use a King-size pillow case to slip over the mat as a covering, and it is usually roomy enough to allow the child to use it as a sleeping bag.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"This was clearly the best A bracket I found on any site.  It was welded and heavy duty.  The 4x6 and 4x4\\'s slid easily into place with only one being a really snug fit (treated wood was still wet from the treatment and was swelled).  I used 14 galvanized wood threaded bolts and washers on each bracket.  Pre-drilling the holes with a drill bit smaller than the galvanized threads allows for easier assembly and minimizes wood cracking.  My daughter\\'s now have a three swing swing set that is as big, if not bigger than the metal framed swings you find at most parks. They will never outgrow this mammoth of a swing set!\"\\n',\n",

When I saw the Baxbo Tummple, I decided I needed to see how it compared. It is so much better!!!<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when opening was the quality of the box it is stored in. The box is very thick/heavy and holds all of the pieces perfectly. It also has the directions printed in the lid so there is no concerns of losing them. The instructions seemed minimal but once you play a few times you realize that they are as thorough as they need to be. The only issue I see that might arise in the future is what to do if there is a tie. There is no information provided for that scenario.<br /><br />The game itself is simple. Rolling the dice will tell you which side you need to place the dice. Each time the structure falls, the person who made the blocks fall must put them in a pile in front of them. At the end of the game, the person with the most &#34;negative points&#34; (AKA- the most blocks), loses! My youngest son is our avid Jenga player. I will update once he plays this with us to let you know a child\\'s perspective. His older brother and I played this several times to see what we thought of it as this will be a Christmas gift for the youngest.<br /><br />I purchased this at a discount in exchange for an honest review of the product.

It came in a set with 300 different pieces that included some square, triangle, wheels, and other pieces.  It had about 7 different colors.  It also included 5 double sided sheets of instructions for different patterns to build (animals, people, cars, etc.).  My son turned 4 in May so I got them out for us to build with.  I started with the hardest pattern to try (one of the bulldozers).  It took me a second to figure out how to get the pieces linked together.  It took my son a few tries to figure it out.  He still has some trouble. The box recommends it is for children ages 3+.  I don\\'t know that he could have done it age 3.  He still can\\'t follow the pattern yet.  I did help him with getting the pieces lined right and he was able to push them down.  I believe in time he will be able to do some of the easier patterns.  Overall they are great blocks.

I would recommend them for any kids that like to build and out things together.  ** I did notice that sone patterns call for x number of pieces in a certain shape.  I wasn\\'t able to find enough in the same color so we had to mix some of the colors.  You can see it in some of my pictures.

The cockpit shell has been configured to allow easy snap-on snap-off to replace the battery. I have been playing with it for a few hours now and i am getting approximately 15 minutes of flight time per charge.<br /><br />One draw back is that the provided charge plugs directly into the drone with the battery installed, preventing any charging while the drone is in use. I have ordered some additional connected and will be creating an adapter that will charge the batteries independently of the drone. Once completed I will update this post with information of my success<br /><br />When ordering you do not have a choice in color. It seems to be randomly selected for you. I received the white one which I am extremely happy with.<br /><br />The learning curve on these things is a bit steep if you have never flown a quad copter before. It is extremely agile and you can easily compensate. I have an X4 H107C that comes with a larger controller than the one provided that also works with this unit. Vice Versa, the smaller controller from this unit with link to the X4 as well. (I personally like the little one during the learning phase)<br /><br />One suggestion I would make if you are a beginner flier is to purchase the blade protector for this model. I think it is about $5 usd and has a couple benefits. #1, it slows the copter down a bit to allow you easier learning of the controls. #2 it saves rotor blade when you crash it.<br /><br />I am going  to try my best to see if I can get another color so I can have flying duels with these things.\"\\n',\n",

We were impressed that even the creatures that are basically the same have slight differences, with arms (wings, whatever) in different positions or something.  We were also hugely impressed with just how much stuff there was in the box.  Wow.  The art throughout (in the game itself, in the instructions) is simply awesome.<br /><br />This really should be played on a table, or another flat, hard surface.  We tried setting it up on the floor, and it doesn\\'t work well on carpet.  We ended up grabbing a large whiteboard and using it instead.<br /><br />Turn Counter -- with that being in the book, we couldn\\'t both keep the marker on the turn counter *and* refer to the instructions at the same time.  Not a big deal, just make a copy of that page of the instructions book for use while playing.<br /><br />The game is for 2-5 players, and we started off by playing with four players in two teams.  The choices available are to play that way, or as a two-player game, or a third option of a free-for-all with either 3, 4, or 5 players.  One really nice thing was that the instructions acknowledged that when playing a free-for-all that players may choose to form temporary alliances and that is fine.<br /><br />This game is a lot more reliant on cards than others we\\'ve played, with most of the action on the battlefield being determined by the cards and how they were being played.<br /><br />The game is limited to 60 turns, and when we first began we thought we\\'d never reach that, as we were already fighting by turn 3.  However, we did end up going to 55 turns before the game was over, so it really can go that far.<br /><br />The game says it is for ages 10+, which seems fairly accurate.

       " '\"I think it\\'s rather inefficient to immediately decry the price when you haven\\'t bought the model itself, especially considering it is a new-tool kit of a rather rare subject, and ships to your local distributor here from Hong Kong. I don\\'t know if anyone has noticed, but shipping things across the planet costs money. Obviously the previous reviewer has never seen a Hasegawa kit, some of which can run upwards of $90 msrp for a 1/48 scale kit, AND which often lack the weaponry, intending for the modeler to spend an additional $20+ buying armament kits to actually arm their models (not every Hasegawa is this way, but a rather surprising amount of them are). While I have not personally purchased the F-16XL yet, I\\'ve heard a number of good things about it on cybermodeler.com, and from the images supplied of the kit in their in-box review, the XL looks to be easily as detailed and well-engineered as their other line, Kinetic models, of which I own the F-16MLU kit, which is easily as good as a Tamiya F-16 kit (MSRP $65.... Also one of the best kits on the market if you\\'re a Viper fan...) and comes with very nice touches like a turned brass pitot tube and also a staggering array of armament, which according to cybermodeler\\'s review also holds true here, despite both the MLU and XL kits representing unarmed aircraft (the MLU kit I have features a Tiger Meet air show MLU and the XL depicted on the box was only armed in trials). This is in stark contrast to some other kit makers (the aforementioned Hasegawa [which, side note, are extremely nice kits despite the high prices, keep your eyes open for deals or go to model shows and swaps for deals, I have the F-2A and F-22 kits by Hasegawa and while the &#34;limited&#34; edition F-2 lacks any JASDF weaponry, I paid $50 for the kit and it is worth it, considering ONLY Hasegawa makes a good F-2A in 1/48 and it is a beautiful kit, and the F-22 is msrp $89.99 and also a beautiful kit, though I didn\\'t pay msrp for mine] and another example of a kit doing that that I personally have would be the Kinetic Mirage 2000B/D/N, which gives one the capability to model the nuclear armed Mirage N without providing an ASMP missile, or Academy\\'s older issue F-15E which gives a modeler four sidewinders and an anti-satellite missile for a ground strike craft) but I digress. Skunk models and their branch Kinetic make quality kits out of good plastic, and as a model builder and a kit maker myself I can attest that the cost of making molds/tooling far exceeds the cost of the plastic or resin that goes into them. That being said, according to cybermodeler (and luckymodel.com which is based in Hong Kong and is a Skunk/Kinetic distributor) the MSRP of this kit is $39.99. It still costs an additional $15-30 to ship here by various means, so that should tell you your seller is counting the cost of having to have the model shipped across the planet. That\\'s why these kits cost a bit extra. Keep an eye out for deals and shop around, but the prices I am seeing on Amazon are not bad for these kits with the level of detail they contain. If you want to pay $15, buy a Revell kit, which you won\\'t find an XL of (not in 1/48 anyway) and then you can attempt to detail your Revell kit to match the much more detailed Kinetic/Skunk/Tamiya/Hasegawa kits. I have F-16s in 1/48 from almost all major manufacturers (Academy F-16C, Tamiya F-16CJ, Hasegawa F-2A, Kinetic F-16AM/MLU, and Revell USA) and of those, the only time the Revell was worth the money to me was when I was 11 and painting with a sponge. Now that I want my models to represent the aircraft I love, I am more willing to spend more money to have a model that is worth putting on my shelf.\"\\n',\n",

I think it\\'s important to note that the clips on the back of the ribbons can be a bit sharp, so I probably wouldn\\'t use them on an infant, but they would be fine for an older child\\'s hair. The brush is small, but a good size for my granddaughter to use when brushing her dolls\\' heads.

       " '\"This swimming Rainbow Trout is absolutely adorable. When you first see this little Rainbow Trout out of the package and in water, it looks like a real fish, especially from a distance. The detail on this Rainbow Trout is amazing down to the little dots on his body and his cute little wiggle eyes. If you didn\\'t know it was a toy, you would think it was real, which is exactly what the man of the house thought when I gave this Rainbow Trout a swim in the bath tub.<br /><br />Getting this Rainbow Trout ready for water is quick and easy. He runs on 1 AA battery which is not included. The battery compartment is well protected so that water does not leak into it, something that is very common with this type of water toy. If you just set the Rainbow Trout in water and turn him on, he floats in the water and swims around like a dead fish. What you need to do is hold the Rainbow Trout under the water until he\\'s filled up with water and then let go and watch him rise to the surface, and then he\\'ll swim normally and not look like a dead fish or a sick fish.<br /><br />The swimming movements that this Rainbow Trout makes are very nice. There is no clicking or mechanical noises made by this fish when it\\'s swimming, so it doesn\\'t look or sound like a toy while it\\'s swimming. When it reaches the corner of the bath tub or hits a wall, the Rainbow Trout realizes this and starts swimming in a different direction away from the wall. This is way better technology than I have seen with some swimming toys that will basically try to swim up the wall, over and over again. The Rainbow Trout has little wiggle eyes that move while he\\'s swimming and is just so adorable.<br /><br />When you are done playing with the Rainbow fish, hold him upright with his head facing upwards and give him a good shake until you do not hear any more water. He holds a lot more water than I thought and I am worried about the possibility of mold growing in this toy in the long run, but only time will tell. It took a little under 2 minutes of shaking to empty the Rainbow Trout out, and then I left him on his side, in the empty bath tub to dry.<br /><br />The battery life of this Rainbow Trout is somewhat concerning. A twenty minute test run and the Rainbow Trout\\'s battery is already needing replaced using Duracell batteries which generally last a long time. I cannot imagine how many batteries he would eat through during a child\\'s bath time.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this Rainbow Trout is adorable, swims well, and knows when it\\'s time to turn and start swimming in a different direction. Despite the battery life, I\\'m giving this product five stars, because he\\'s one of the cutest and least mechanical swimming bath toys that I have seen to date.<br /><br />I was provided with this product for free in exchange for my honest reviewlittle under 2 minutes of shaking to empty the Rainbow Trout out, and then I left him on his side, in the empty bath tub to dry.<br /><br />The battery life of this Rainbow Trout is somewhat concerning.

I am new to the world of Brio (our kids played with other brands of building sets when they were this age), so maybe this is a non-issue, but I do dislike the fact that because it obviously can\\'t be flipped over like other standard pieces of track, it always has to be set on an inside curve.

       " '\"First of all, let me say that I cannot imagine any cat in its right mind that would allow this horn to stay on for more than five seconds, so just be warned - your cat will not be pleased with this accessory and will want to immediately remove it. I bought it for the purpose of taking a few quick pictures since I don\\'t enjoy making my cat unhappy and would advise against thinking your cat should wear this horn for long periods of time, unless you happen to have an extremely laid-back cat.  That being said, this &#34;evil&#34; unicorn horn is really adorable. It blew up easily and the plastic spout used to inflate it has one of those valves which prevents air from coming back out even if it\\'s not plugged, which was definitely handy. It also features little ridges on the sides, which I\\'m guessing are for the purpose of making the horn look more authentic.  It was a little tricky to figure out how to put the horn on - evidently you\\'re supposed to put both loops over your cat\\'s entire head, with one back by his throat and one underneath his chin. At first I put it on sideways, looping the bands over my cat\\'s ears, but it didn\\'t stay on at all like that. Once I put it on correctly it stayed on long enough to get a couple of pictures, even through my cat\\'s repeated batting of it - I keep his claws clipped, though, and I could easily imagine it being popped by a persistent cat with longer claws.  All in all, I got a bunch of adorable pictures and my cat was well-rewarded afterward with treats and affection - I\\'m a happy customer!\"\\n',\n",

I wouldn\\'t spend the $100+ on the equivalent Lego set, but this price was right in my wheelhouse.<br /><br />Here are my thoughts, the good and the bad, in no particular order.<br />* There is no box. The pieces come grouped into smaller bags, much like Lego, inside a larger bag. Lego boxes immediately go into the recyling bin anyway so I didn\\'t mind, but if you are giving this as a gift then it\\'s something you may want to consider.<br />* Most pieces are virtually identical to Lego, but certain things (like steering wheels and the minifigs) are different.<br />* The colors for some (yellow) are also different than Lego. Not worse, not better, just different.<br />* The instructions are the same as Lego. I\\'ve read some criticisms that the instructions are poor, but they look exactly the same. In fact, one issue I have with Lego\\'s instructions are that I often have trouble telling whether a piece in the instructions is light gray or dark gray, and Sluban is the same way.<br />* The plane is surprisingly long! It\\'s easily over a foot long, and some of the extra things they include are pretty cool (silverware and food). Not sure if Lego includes this, but I liked it.<br />* It also includes a brick separator, which I thought was a nice touch.<br /><br />If you\\'re considering this, give it a shot. I\\'ll definitely buy another Sluban set.\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"We love One Night Ultimate Werewolf, and this expansion (fully playable on its own) gives us more reasons to love it. We have all the cards in one box and mix and match most of the time. When we show the game to new people, we start out with the basic set of cards for a few rounds. Then we start throwing in cards like the Apprentice Seer, Mystic Wolf and Witch and explain those roles. I like the Revealer, who looks at a player\\'s card and turns it face up unless that player is a Werewolf, in which case the card gets turned face down; when I\\'m the Revealer I like to announce who I am before we open our eyes so no one thinks I just see the card and lie.<br /><br />Lying is a major factor in this game, and it takes a little while to get the hang of it. It\\'s super-simple, too; basically, the Villagers (everyone but the Werewolves) win if they shoot the Werewolves (in gameplay, this simply involves pointing fingers at them ;)), and the Werewolves win if they don\\'t get shot. 3-10 players (you can play more with expansions, I guess, but the most we\\'ve played with so far is seven). Three players is OK but I really prefer a minimum of four. But if only three people are around, I\\'ll always play. :)<br /><br />The game is best played with the companion app for cell phone or tablet placed on the table. In the night phase all players close their eyes and perform the actions of their character, as bidden by the voices in the app. Background sounds can block out the sounds of people swapping or otherwise moving cards around. Then in the day phase you wake up and start trying to figure out who\\'s who and see if any werewolves are going to get killed (or survive).<br /><br />I was in on the Kickstarter for the upcoming One Night Ultimate Vampire game and am looking forward to adding those cards to the lineup.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"- The stones arrived in plastic bags, which were inside the bowls--the bowls themselves were situated in the carrying bag. Once they were washed & oiled (more on this below), they were lovely & had a nice heft. The opacity of the black stones when held up to the light was variable, but on the board they are uniform in color. I received at least 7 extras of each color, with only one broken stone.<br />- The bowls are pleasant enough; I would prefer solid wood, but wanted my limited budget to go toward maximally-sized stones. The bowls hold the stones with a little room to spare & seem solid with well-fitting lids. As I\\'ve just received them I can\\'t comment on any issues with cracks forming between the pressed strips although I\\'ve no reason for concern yet; they seem perfectly sound.<br />- The bag is pragmatic, although the side-loading feature is clever, with a simple thick fabric square sewn into the bottom to keep the bowls from rubbing against one another. A nice touch is metal feet on the bottom of the bag, keeping the bottom from additional wear. Of all the elements, the bag seems most likely to expire first, but I\\'m confident that--with reasonable handling--that shouldn\\'t be a concern for some time.<br />- Washing & Oiling the Stones:<br /> As is mentioned on the Yellow Mountain website, & a number of other go-related fora, yunzi stones come in a protective powder & must at least be washed before they can be used. After washing & drying thoroughly, it is recommended that one oil the stones both for aesthetic reasons & to protect against the stones scratching. It is important to use a non-drying oil, such as sewing machine oil, so that the stones do not become gummy (vegetable oils, for example, are not to be used for this very reason). Once the stones are oiled, & the excess rubbed off, they have a beautiful matte luster. The process can take a couple hours, but it is most definitely worth it.<br />- Verdict:<br />Highly recommended; the price is a bargain; you pay less for bamboo bowls, but get more stone mass for your $. Expect to invest a little time & effort before they\\'re ready to play, but expect also a nice payoff in the end.\"\\n',\n",

The first thing I learned is that the beach balls are measured based on the length of half the circumference rather than the diameter. Once I figured out that I needed the 12&#34; size (which are smaller than a typical beach ball), I saw that a lot of buyers of similar products complained that they either did not match the photos or were hard to inflate since the one-way valves either did not work or were absent (so air leaks out before you can close it).<br /><br />This particular brand is more expensive than some, but description indicated that they were higher quality than the others. I ended up getting a discount on these so the price was very good. So far there have been no damaged ones and they do look like the photos which is exactly what I wanted. The one-way valves are not perfect, but they work better than the existing one that I have so I can keep most of the air in them when closing the valve. Also they don\\'t seem perfectly round, but I would not even have thought about this if it had not been mentioned in the description, so that does not bother me anyway.<br /><br />My toddler was very excited to be able to take this to the beach, and his friend wanted one also.

Some spell descriptions can\\'t fit on the card, but page numbers in the PHB tell you where to find the longer description.  Every spell in the 5th edition players handbook is present, and expansion packs for the new spells come out when applicable (ex: Temple of Elemental Evil).<br /><br />How we use:  Add known spells to the players pile of cards.  Place ready spells into rows according to level.  Place a glass bead representing unused spell slots near each row for its level (we use different colored beads for each level as well).  Remove a glass bead when that spell level of spell is cast.<br /><br />Certainly not required, but if you can afford the little niceties, it\\'s totally worth the money to stop digging the PHB constantly.<br />(Of Note. the box can be a bit flimsy, might want to get something stronger to store it in.)\"\\n',\n",

I was worried when I saw the other reviews that it would be a mission to build.  Let me tell you, we had it done in under an hour with 2 adults building it. (Hubby did the table, but I helped with the track).<br /><br />My son does not stop playing with it! It\\'s the perfect height for him to reach around and play with everything. I especially like the track around the edge,  gives him a great place to put his extra cars.<br /><br />Only thing I am debating is whether I want to wood glue the track down. It is built really well, but my little one likes to pull certain pieces off and then he gets frustrated putting them back.<br /><br />Overall I LOVE it ! It is worth the money\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"This product is fantastic! My 6 year old was able to do everything by herself except fill a thing with hot water from the faucet. No microwave or stove needed. My daughter loved the independence she had with using this. She\\'s excited to make chocolates as gifts for the holidays. This is very educational for young children. They learn to follow instructions, that are very easy to follow, pictures explain every step. Also they learn about measuring, measuring how much chocolate to add without going over. Also, we added food coloring so learned about making different colors. Another important thing was learning to wait patiently, which was probably the hardest part for my daughter. We set a timer and she had to wait. After everything was done she had to clean it all up. I love the fact that she could do this on her own. It\\'s really cute too! There\\'s many different chocolate shapes you can make. We did receive this for review but review is 100% honest opinion. Highly recommend.\"\\n',\n",

I got this for a little girl\\'s first birthday, she was really excited to climb on it and push it around. It makes a really cute and easy push toy too until they learn how to use their feet. It\\'s the perfect size too, my 11 month old\\'s toes just barely hit the floor but he is rather small. The little girl I got it for was able to sit and comfortably reach the floor with no problem. Really cute and simple toys are the way to go. And you really can\\'t beat the Little Tikes brand. You know you\\'re getting a high quality toy from a trusted company, not something cheap or junky that doesn\\'t work or is going to break in a week. Even the antennae are sturdy. I would absolutely recommend this for little ones!\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"This gun is fun to use and packs a punch. The mega darts hit pretty hard as far as Nerf darts go and whistle as they are travelling through the air. The gun looks cool and is easy to fire. You can either pump it and fire when ready or just hold the trigger and keep pumping it to fire one dart after another very quickly. The hardest part is reloading the 10 round drum but once you do it a few times you will adapt. My wife likes using the gun, my 8 year old son likes using the gun, and I like using the gun. So overall we all like it and would recommend it.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"This is a fantastic kit for young minds, it allows for the exploration of the engineering of locomotion.  The quadruped, biped and arm-over-arm methods are explored in this one kit.  Essentially a simple robotics kit that allows for the remote controlled robot to be constructed in different forms to demonstrate the variations of locomotion.<br /><br />It\\'s an excellent kit and the construction method is similar to the old style advanced Lego kits.  Anyone can manage this method of construction and, given that the kit only requires one motor and one remote, I expect that nearly anyone can manage to build all three bots and truly enjoy the exploration.<br /><br />If you are one of those people that used to build simple mechanical bots in middle-school, then you might have a blast helping your kids explore the great kit... and the others.<br /><br />This is a great educational toy that I can recommend very highly.\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"I\\'ve played through this several times now, and enjoy it a lot. The choices of when to spend life, when to destroy cards, and how to deal with the various hazards and pirates give you a lot of strategic options in a relatively simple rule set.<br />The art on the cards is great, very amusing and evocative of whatever the card\\'s describing, and they handle easily while also not taking up too much space. They\\'re like small Tarot cards: much taller than they are wide. Cards are of good quality, thick and with nice printing.<br />The life tokens are painted wood Eurogame-style pieces, very cool and different from the generic designs found in other games. They come in a resealable bag.<br />The three mini-boards/tiles for the different stacks of cards are nicely printed and have a bit of reference material on them, as well.<br />This game gets extra points for having a rather small box, minimal instructions, and components that can be easily and quickly put back in the box. The \\'mini-boards\\' concept works a lot better and lasts a lot longer than a quad-folding board.<br />Overall, great solo game. Fun to play and fun to watch others play. Robinson has a lot of character, and the multiple challenge levels and scoring system add even more replayability to this. It\\'s worth checking out!\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"There are so many great tablets built with an Intel® Atom™ based processor, including the Kurio Xtreme tablet for kids. I got to check out the Kurio Xtreme with my family and it has been a hit.  Even my husband has used it, and he usually avoids kids &#34;toys.&#34; Well the Kurio Xtreme is not a toy, it is a beast of a tablet thanks to the Intel® Atom™ based processor. It loads up right away and downloads apps before I realize it. Speed is not the only thing that I like about the Kurio Xtreme, there are lots of great features on it.<br />Features I like on the Kurio Xtreme:<br /><br />Comes pre-loaded with more than 90 apps including popular games like Fruit Ninja, Subway Surfer and Cut the Rope 2. You get access to over 150 e-books as well.<br /><br />Kurio Genius parental controls. You can set up different profiles for your kids and decide their internet access, apps they can play and times they can play on the device.  This is awesome because as a busy mom I don\\'t have time to sit and monitor what each child is doing on their tablets or if I\\'m not with them I don\\'t have to worry. My kids bring their tablets to friends houses and their grandparents and with Kurio Xtreme Parental Controls and Profiles, its like I am watching over them.<br /><br />Going along with Parental Controls, Kurio has the Kurio Genius Internet Filtering System. This filters, categorizes and updates 450+ million websites daily to make sure kids are staying safe online and not viewing anything they are not supposed to. Parents can set the strictness of controls and lessen controls as kids grow.<br /><br />7-inch touch screen with 5-point multi-touch. Let\\'s face it, kids want to touch screens, its being the norm now that even with our non-touch screen computer they try to touch the screen. We haven\\'t had any issues with the touch screen.<br /><br />Android Operating System - This is great because not only do you get the Google Play Store but also the Amazon App Store. Kurio also has their own app store you can get kid-friendly apps from.<br /><br />Create up to 8 profiles, perfect for everyone in the family. Yes this is not just a kids tablet, I can log in onto my profile and check my email, play a game, surf the web or go on my social networks. Then when I am done, I log out and my kids can log into their own profiles and just access what I allow them to.<br /><br />1st tablet with Body Motion Gaming! This is seriously awesome. My whole family has done this and it is a great way to unwind. We just prop on the kitchen counter with the included stand and pick a game under Motion Sport such as skiing, soccer, swimming or running and we start moving. A picture of you pops up on the bottom right and you have to move to make your character move on the screen. The faster you move, the faster your player will move! Its funny to see us working up a sweat playing a game in the kitchen!<br /><br />Includes protective bumper. I appreciate when tablets come with a case because it is one less thing I need to buy and I can let my kids use it right out of the box without worrying.<br /><br />Categorize games for profiles. you can categorize where the games fit. The categories include Games, Educational, Media, Ebooks and more. You can then go a step further and choose which categories are subject to time management. For example, lets say you are fine with your child reading Ebooks all day or anything in the Educational category but for the Games category you want it limited to certain hours of the day - well you can do that!<br /><br />What I wish it had:<br /><br />I do wish it was a little bit bigger but 7 inches is a decent size.<br /><br />It would be nice too if there was a stand that popped out from the back rather than came separate so we don\\'t have to prop it when we don\\'t have the stand with us.<br /><br />More Body Motion games.<br /><br />Overall, I really like the features of the Kurio Xtreme. It makes it really easy to manage my kids on it and we allhave fun using it. For the price of just over $100, I\\'d say its a good value and it can be a tablet that grows with your child or one that all your child share (if thats possible) with their own profiles. There is so much that can be customized on this tablet from the profile screens to what games the categories go in. I feel like we haven\\'t even scratched the surface of what this tablet will do, especially because one of my three kids is usually on it so I don\\'t get much play time on it.<br /><br />I received this product complimentary in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.have fun using it.

The assembled sunken treasure chest/bone cage display are OK in the set, their adequate, but it\\'s just kind of generic, especially when compared to the sub itself. Now the addition of two divers and a shark was nice touch and affords some room for play time scenarios. The submersible, though, is the jewel of the set and everything about the sub looks marvellous. Everything looks good in this set as whole, and if you can afford to marry up either the smaller sets in the theme, or one of the larger then you have a great set piece and lastly this beauty, meaning the sub, can float and it floats real well!<br /><br />.\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"Its a great little charger. I just got into quadcopters and this charger had the features I wanted, and its been performing well for me. My batteries have XT60 connectors so the included connectors are charging them nicely. It charges very fast and while I\\'m sure there\\'s fancier chargers out there, this one suits me fine. It supports every battery I need and it has a lot of options for charging output, and you can save customized charging settings for each battery you have, which is a nice feature.<br /><br />This charger does come with a cable that has a plug for the input to the charger on one end, and aligator clips on the other, but it does not have an AC adapter included. You could either buy an adapter and hope it includes the proper connector, plug it into a 12v battery terminal, or do what i did: I found an old 12v 2a adapter for a router i dont use anymore, I cut the wires and stripped away a small lead and clipped on the included aligator clips and powered the unit like that. Its working great so far.\"\\n',\n",

I was dreading the set up, as we have a few similar toys that were nightmares to get up and running. I was surprised at how easy it was to set up and charge. It only took a few &#34;test flights&#34; to get the hang of the controls, and i love that its multidirectional. The battery stays charged plenty long enough for a fun afternoon. It kept all three of my kids 13, 10, and 7 fully immersed in play all afternoon which is a win for any mom. I\\'m very glad I decided to go ahead and grab this.  I was offered this product at a discount in exchange for my honest thoughts on it.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"[[VIDEOID:c3022c076c09ab44153cf1e1de508fc5]]The Dreamwalker obviously isn\\'t for anyone, including children, those under 5\\' tall, and 220 pounds on up.  Perhaps I could exclude myself on the grounds that I don\\'t have that innate finely honed balance that one should have before attempting to ride.  Some people are naturals and can skate board, snow board, ski or use a self-balancing scooter with ease.  This is certainly not a toy and although many find it easy to use with little challenges, others I know who\\'ve tried have taken potentially serious spills.  Take a pass if you don\\'t have the coordination to manage the Dreamwalker.<br /><br />I\\'ve had the Dreamwalker for a couple of weeks now and people shy away from it like it had the plague.  It\\'s a totally solid piece of machinery and I\\'ve had zero problems with the battery.  I\\'ve been testing it on and off, when no one\\'s looking of course, and really like it.  I rather draw the line at the word \\\\\\\\\"\"love,\\\\\\\\\"\" but as far as the technology and the quality of this self-balancing scooter, it\\'s top-notch.  I wouldn\\'t go so far as to say that learning how to ride is intuitive because it\\'s not.  People do rave about how easy it is, but that \\\\\\\\\"\"easy\\\\\\\\\"\" comes with practice and allowing the body to relax and guide the Dreamwalker.<br /><br />First up, getting on (and subsequently off) the scooter is the critical part.  The way to mount the Dreamwalker\\'s platform is to quickly put your strongest foot up first very quickly followed by your other one.  It\\'s rather like a quick hop.  Getting off the scooter is just the reverse.  Quickly dismount to the rear with you weakest foot first and then your strong one.  If you have a hallway where you can move freely up and down, that would be the perfect practice field so to speak.  Seriously don\\'t believe these people who pick it up in five minutes and are off.<br /><br />I had problems initially because I was not letting my body do the work, but I was trying to insist the scooter do what I wanted.  The key, for me anyway, was to relax and not overthink the task at hand.  You still won\\'t see me traveling to the local store in back anytime soon, but I am quickly gaining a decent amount of control.  Not to discourage anyone, but I just want to be more realistic.  This is great fun, but not intuitive.  Oh, and I had a rock climbing helmet on and I suggest that anyone who uses one put on the protective gear.  The first few attempts at getting on and off the Dreamwalker just could throw you on your back.<br /><br />The Dreamwalker has a lithium ion battery, which is the ultimate in dependable.  When I want to charge it\\'s simply an overnight deal.  It does come fully charged, but instead of waiting with bated breath, the overnight makes like simple.  The body of the Dreamwalker appears to be an impact-resistant polyurethane, but obviously not scratch-resistant.  Until you get really good at working with this self-balancing scooter, you can easily put your own bumpers on.  I\\'m not really worried about scuffing (it will happen) try putting some self-adhesive weather seal on until you are good at it.  It\\'s rather like putting training wheels on a bicycle.<br /><br />There are seriously no problems with the Dreamwalker, but the problems are with the user.  I need to learn to relax more instead of trying to think for the scooter.  What is does is pick up on my subtle muscle movements.  When I first tried it out, it seemed as if my body were resisting and the scooter decided I wanted to go backwards each time.  As I mentioned, a hallway would be a great practice field.  The hands can lightly guide and give some confidence.  I was all over the place for a while, but fortunately I didn\\'t fall.  The Dreamwalker is the ultimate in cool, high-quality, but not intuitive.  Would I recommend it?  If you are capable, yes, but it you can\\'t walk and chew gum, take a pass.<br /><br />SPECS:<br /><br />► Weight:  26.45 pounds  (12 kg)<br />►  Motor Power:  1000W<br />► Drive Mode:  Dual-Wheel and two-way direct drive<br />►  Rated Speed: 8km/hour<br />►  Balance Detection:  3 gyro sensors + 3 accelerometers<br />►  Mileage:  9.20 miles (15 kilometers)<br />►  Battery Capacity: 110Wh<br />►  Control System:  Leray Smart Walker<br />►  Rated Load: 220 pounds (90KG)<br />►  Battery Capacity: 110Wh<br /><br />WHAT\\'S IN THE BOX:<br /><br />1.

       " '\"Very cute decoration for Son\\'s 7th birthday party!  As soon as I saw them here on Amazon, I knew they would be an ideal decoration for upcoming shark-themed birthday party this past June, but was hesitant at first since I read another review that claimed these were a bit delicate.I\\'m so glad I ended up purchasing shark inflatables as they were too cute, with tons of compliments, and as for being easily damaged, our experience has demonstrated these are anything but decorations only!  Once we had these blown up a day or so before Son\\'s  party, he and his rambunctious 4-year-old sister  just couldn\\'t seem to stay away from the sharks, even as we advised numerous times for them to leave the &#34;fragile&#34; decorations alone. From sword fighting to rolling around on top of them, every time we would be out of sights range, someone would have to be rough-housing with one of all three of these decorations. Not sure why this was, it just seemed as though these had some kind of hypnotic pull that kept my children coming for them at every turn.  Finally they were hidden away until the day of the party, which ended up being one of the windiest outdoor parties ever, with 60 mph gusts at times, even tarps surrounding pavilion of park could not keep the horrendous winds from blowing everything, including decorations. For these guys, hanging from the top of the pavilion in a triangular formation, they may have gotten some of the worst drafts being higher than some of the tarps extended.  Even so, with so much abuse already dealt to the hapless shark blow-ups, at clean up time the sharks were taken down and remained full of air. Some days later, I found the blue shark inflatable in my Daughter\\'s toy box, tail tied in a knot, yet most of it, everything above the tail still had air in it, as did the other inflatables.  Once kids found inflatables\\' third hiding spot, with the heat of summer bearing down, the pool became their common hang-out spot complete with the inflatable sharkswhere they continued to use throughout July and into August. I guess I could\\'ve continued to remove the items and find yet another hiding spot, but by then, I figured at least the inflatables are being put to good use other than the one-time birthday decoration they were intended to be. It is now almost September, with Summer winding down and school around the corner, the sharks are now lying quietly in the pool-deck box, they still contain most of their air that was originally blown into them more than 2 months earlier, with no additional air being applied, and through all the play and well...abuse to put it mildly, they seem to be still going strong. Completely worth the minimal price paid, with more uses than decorations, who knew? Definitely worth the money! While I wouldn\\'t buy them specifically for use as an inflatable toy, just know they may be utilized in that fashion once their primary function has been performed! Recycling is great in any form!!\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"Too Many Cinderellas by Grail Games. This tabletop game is for 2-4 players that are ages 10 + (My 8 yr plays), and is about 10 mins long. You play as town people who are spreading rumors for the Prince to hear. He will pick his Cinderella based off of the rumors that you spread. Anyone can actually become Cinderella. A male, senior, or even a cat. Yes, an actual meow cat! Which is my daughters favorite card from this game.<br /><br />I was actually quite surprised how great the quality of this game is. The box is made out of a thick cardboard with beautiful bright prints. Once you open it up. All the components fit nicely and won’t be rattling around in your box.  The art work on the lien cards are just beautiful! They use light pastel colors that most princess loving girls enjoy. The “diamonds” were both of the girls favorite components. They wanted them all. What girl can turn down the silliness and cuteness of the game!<br /><br />Too Many Cinderellas is similar in scope to the Love Letter games.  It is a quick, small deck based game where you earn the most tokens (diamonds) over a few rounds to win. Each card you lay down has an action, in this case a rumor. It’s easy enough to talk and enjoy your company while playing. However, it’s interesting enough to keep you pulling it out to play again. We truly enjoyed this game. I hope you check it out for yourself, or for a little girl in your life.

       " '\"Top-notch Lego set for STAR WARS Fans.  Build difficulty and intricacies: Medium, but needs teenager at least. - Though a young child can put most of it together, a teenager at least is needed to optimise the build. See below. - My 5.5 year old took about 7.5 hours to complete this. This is the same time as the UCS B-Wing, even though the UCS is arguably more complicated. This is because of the issue with the pegs that make up the lateral fold-out joints of the hull. - These pegs cannot be pushed all the way into the socket. If you inspect them carefully, there is a small bulge just below the head of the peg. If you push the peg all the way into the socket, it jams the hinge and any attempt to fold out the hull not only causes an annoying squeaking noise, the resistance exerts stress on the Lego plates that often leads to parts of the hull falling off whenever you fold it out. After discovering this, I had to disassemble the adjacent sections of the hull plates and ask my son to re-do it again (which is why it took him as long as it did). 95% into the socket is enough.  Play value: High, considering the size of the set. - a Command Centre section that lifts off to reveal the interior, and the upper hull plates folding outward and down to reveal the rest. - two spring-loaded missiles that fire forward, with storage for two more at the rear of the bridge. - swivelling turbolaser cannons on both sides - Many minifigures  Display value-for-money: High. - It isn\\'t the same as the UCS Star Destroyer, but it looks impressive and detailed.  Trivia (for Star Wars vehicle buffs): - The proportions of the Bridge and the swivelling turbolaser cannons fit the blueprints of a Victory-Class Star Destroyer rather than an Imperial Star Destroyer. (See the Star Wars Vehicles and Vessels diagrams.) This is a minor point really, and does not detract from the beauty of this set.\"\\n',\n",

China may be famous for it\\'s bootlegs, but I do love this guy quite a lot! Heck, he even goes good with my Espeon plush, or any Eevee plush collection or a collection of other Eevee merchandise. Like I said earlier, Umbreon did come fast and he came from a pretty reliable seller as well!<br /><br />This Umbreon plush is very soft, but the stuffing is somewhat stiff though. He is well constructed, but there are some flaws with him, All the rings on his body, except for one, which was flawed a little bit, were perfectly made. His red eyes are beautiful yet fierce looking for a Dark type Pokemon, similar to a cat\\'s eyes. He sadly does not stand up well and does tumble often due to his paws not being pointed down and rather being in a straight line.<br /><br />Note: There are more bootlegs of this Umbreon plush than authentic ones. The ones that are sold on Amazon and eBay are mainly being sold by Chinese vendors. If you want an authentic one from Japan or the Pokemon Center USA website and not a bootleg from China or Hong Kong, you could be out of luck. The bootlegs are much cheaper, and if you order one, it could be poorly made.<br /><br />Despite being a counterfeit Umbreon plush, this was worth the money. Any Eevee or Umbreon fan will be pleased with this.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"I always loved &#34;Lilo and Stitch&#34;, and have fond memories of watching the cartoon on TV as a child.<br />Experiment 624, known as Angel, from the classic Disney television cartoon “Lilo and Stich: The Series”, is Stitch’s adorable and pretty feminine counterpart. This lovely plushie of her is quite difficult to come by, so when she showed up at the Disney Store in my local mall, I purchased her right away. I picked her up, held her, and just couldn’t leave without her – I am indeed happy that I bought her! She goes well with my Stitch plush and is very nice to hug and cuddle. She is a roughly medium-sized plush, about 10 inches tall, a bit smaller than the Disney Store Stitch plush (despite being just as large as Stitch as portrayed in the cartoon). However, the quality of this plush toy is just spectacular.<br /><br />This is probably the best plushie of Angel you will ever find. She is accurate, authentic, and absolutely adorable. She is made with a velvety fabric that is sublimely soft to the touch. Her hot-pink colours are very vivid and emphasize her girlish charm, differentiating her from her boy counterpart, Stitch.<br /><br />She is very pudgy and cuddly, with a rounded body shape. She is stuffed so that she is very squishy-soft and huggable, yet she retains her shape perfectly, as she is very well-constructed and durable.<br /><br />The details are wonderful! This sweet little mischievous girl alien, Angel, has a koala-like look about her, just like Stitch. She has big black eyes with little lashes, a big round lavender purplish nose, and super-soft, long rounded rabbit-like ears. Her colouration and markings are spot-on. Most of her body is a vivid hot-pink colour, her underbelly, inner ears, and the rings around her eyes are a soft rose shade, her blunt claws and paw pads are magenta, and she has purplish patches on her antennae and ear tips. She has a white heart-shaped mark on her chest, and another large purple upside-down heart-shaped mark on her back.<br /><br /> I particularly love her long, gracefully flowing tendril-like antennae, as well as her cute lil’ bob-tail.<br />One of the paw pads on her feet has an official Disney Store logo on it, so you can tell it is the authentic product.<br /><br />This is a truly adorable and wonderful plushie, and I highly recommend it to fans of Lilo and Stitch.

       " '\"I had fifteen dollars lying around and my best friend\\'s address, so I ordered this for him. I had it gift-wrapped, added a letter, and sent it to his house. It came to his door one day BEFORE the estimated delivery date (and it shipped to the east coast from California). The box was much larger than the product (great for storage, thanks Amazon). The gift wrapping was high quality and matched the classic Amazon colors (I\\'m saving it for this Christmas).  For a single-piece plastic item, my friend was very impressed with the packing, it was surrounded in wrapping paper and air cushions (re-gifted as toys for my pets). He said the wand itself came exactly as pictured and the plastic felt very durable, with the star and handle are one molded piece and very hard to break apart. The rainbow gradient would match any pink or purple fairy, princess, witch, or stripper costume. At first I did not believe him.  My friend gave this to his younger sister (she is 18 months old) when she was crying. Not only did she stop crying, she was intrigued by the amazing build quality of this magic wand and played with it for the next 30 minutes. An hour later, my friend found it in his goldfish bowl, with Mr. Goldy (his pet goldfish) swimming through and around it. Holding it from the top end, my friend was able to use it as a replacement drum stick when one of his broke, until he could get a new wooden one.  I truly believe it is a five-star product. At such a cheap price, it comes out on top - compared to other magic or costume wands anywhere. I visited his house and he showed me this wand I bought for him. I was amazed at not only the amazing quality of this product, but also at the fact my friend was telling the truth.  This product is now in an antique display case above the headboard of his bed, being saved for the generations that will follow him, to spare them from the fate of horrible, ever-expanding Chinese build quality.  Here are 13 reasons you should consider buying this item: 1. Great for any fairy/princess costume. 2. Toys for your pet dog or cat. 3. Shipping Box large enough for future storage or moving. 4. Durable plastic, capable of receiving abuse. 5. Exactly as pictured, excluding white backdrop. 6. Brilliantly colored rainbow gradient. 7. Great centerpiece for a room. 8. Decent temporary drum stick. 9. Entertainment for a small child. 10. Good aquarium prop for a small goldfish. 11. Reestablishes trust with close friends. 12. Spares you from cheap, Chinese toys. 13. Madly hilarious entertainment for a teenager (16).  CONS: 1. There was no instruction manual. 2. It is not a six-point star.  For the $15 I spent on this product, the return on investment is astounding.\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"This is the first Schleich product I\\'ve ever had, so I looked up the spinosaurus, and found that experts no longer think it looks like the Jurassic Park type, but the back legs were shorter and the spine fin was not humped, but rather wavy, and it had webbed feet.  Probably, it was an aquatic creature that lived on fish. That being said, this is still an impressive monster that was the largest dinosaur ever, and the toy is impressive, too.  The detail is most impressive, with the scales, teeth and tongue.  The jaw opens and shuts, but my two year old doesn\\'t mess with that.  He\\'s been in the sand box, Play-doh, and tub so far and no chipping of the color or pieces yet.  I love that the feet are perfectly balanced.  You know how sometimes only two feet are on the ground and the others totter?  Not this one.  It has a good heft to it and even the tongue is raised.  The colors don\\'t bleed into another area.  This is a high quality product.  My only question is, why did they say it was violet?\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"I\\'m really satisfied with this kit. This was my first build of anything RC, and although it wasn\\'t the breeziest thing ive ever done, it was do-able without a lot of frustration. There are numerous youtube videos that explain how to assemble these kits if you aren\\'t sure what you\\'re doing, so id recommend those.<br /><br />The kit includes most of what i needed, but I had to buy nylon hex spacers for mounting the flight controller after the kit came because I assumed there would be some included, but there were none. There were all the screws needed (and some extra) but no spacers. There is some piece of an adapter that comes in the kit that i can only assume is a battery connector, but I opted to buy some XT60 connectors because that seems like the new standard.<br /><br />Once I got it all assembled, the kit is very very sturdy. It does not feel like its going to break easy, and after 6 days of flying and probably 20 crashes, it does not seem to have any structural issues. Ive cartwheeled it in tall grass plenty of times, and while the plastic props I bought can get bent easily, the frame holds up great. I did break a small piece of it off in the back by flying backwards into a house, but even so its still very sturdy. The carbon fiber blades that come with it are good quality, and they fly much steadier than the plastic gemfans i bought, but i was able to break one pretty easily nonetheless. They hold up great for crashes, but don\\'t let them hit anything hard like concrete because they can break more easily.<br /><br />One of the downsides of this kit that i didn\\'t like is that the holes for the motor were not drilled out enough. I had to drill all of the motor holes out more myself. Not only was it too narrow for the screw to fit, the holes weren\\'t tall or wide enough to accommodate the screw hole patterns on the motors. Be prepared to have to drill the motor mounts. And i was able to loose the dampening camera mount easily so i\\'d say don\\'t fly with it on unlessyou are going to use it.<br /><br />Everything in the picture comes in the kit, including the two wire pieces and the two heat shrink cables. I was a little concerned that it might not come with a power distribution board because it was not listed in the description so i bought another one anyways, but i can confirm that it comes with one inside the kit. All in all, this was a great buy and im really happy with it. I mean, you can\\'t beat the price, this has the same stuff that kits that cost 50 dollars more have.\"\\n',\n",

I doubt that the gears will wear unless you plan on running it constantly for long periods of time. I chose to clean the grease off in favor of reduced drag.

So yes, very much worth the higher cost.<br /><br />With the Riding Arena set, we have a nice introduction to the Schleich horse world. The set includes a beautiful hand-painted horse, saddle and accessories that can be outfitted, and a riding paddock area with fence. It may seem sparse at first but when paired with the playmat that is sold separately, it makes for quite a nice set piece.  What we like about the arena is that it is open - so the horse can be easily seen when played with - the building doesn\\'t get in the way.  Opening windows make an additional nice touch.<br /><br />We greatly enjoy our Schleich horses and sets and I enjoy having a toy that can be passed down to each child and then saved for grandchildren one day.\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"Wrath of the Righteous (WotR) is a table top game that uses a combination of cards and dice to create a high fantasy adventure for 1 - 4 players (more if you have the character expansion pack). The game is cooperative - all players work together to achieve each game scenario\\'s goal. Everything you need to play is in this one box (dice, cards, rules), though expansions and various accessories are also available. The game itself is a hybrid of both traditional board games and roleplaying games (RPGs) - shuffled cards determine what treasure you will find and monsters you will face, and your character becomes stronger after every scenario as he/she battles the hordes of darkness. No game master (GM) is required, though a moderate amount of setup and takedown time is necessary for each scenario.<br /><br />Wrath of the Righteous is relatively easy to learn to play, but will require some reading of the rulebook in order to properly understand. Each player controls a different character with special abilities and equipment (represented by cards). Characters take turns searching locations and dealing with what they discover - be it monsters, treasure, or horrible villains. Cards are played to represent what the character does or uses, and dice rolls determining success or failure.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game (ACG) is incredibly fun, and Wrath of the Righteous is one of the most enjoyable sets so far. WotR allows a high fantasy adventure experience whenever a player wants it, without the need for a willing GM or an exact group of friends to properly play. I still love traditional roleplaying games (along with their flexibility and potential for incredible story experiences), but this ACG is also a great deal of fun - I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars (rounded to 5). An incredible game for those looking for high fantasy adventure. Does require some setup and takedown time, as well as a decent understanding of the rulebook.<br /><br />Tip: Do not mark the cards in this set. Either print a character sheet and mark it to track character progress, or purchase card sleeves and then mark on them with a felt-tip ink pen (the sleeve goes over the card, but can be removed when you want to play the character over). Sleeve size will most likely be Standard Card Game Sleeve size, though this can vary slightly by manufacturer.<br /><br />Accessories and Expansions: WotR and the other PACGs have a number of accessories and expansions available for them - everything from new adventures (called &#34;Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Deck&#34; and the number) to miniatures that represent the characters and contain unique cards (&#34;Pathfinder Iconic Heroes&#34;). None of these things are necessary for new players to have, and may even create unnecessary confusion. For those people that really want to start with a more complete PACG experience, however, I would recommend two possible purchases: the Wrath of the Righteous Character Add-On Deck ($20 or less retail on release) and the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Mat (retailing at roughly $25-$30 on release). The character add-on deck provides more characters for players to choose from; the play mat makes it easier to figure out where cards should be placed, and helps prevent them from sliding (not to mention making the game look more organized and appealing, IMO). These accessories/expansions are nice to have, but not necessary to enjoy the game (especially when first purchased).\"\\n',\n",

The micro size is very durable for high speed crashes, however it makes the copter nearly unflyable outside in the wind.<br />The pluses:  great for the price, parts are cheap (you can buy any part).  Good power and a quality controller.  Easy to fly - with practice, and I still crash a lot.  Only the faster crashes will cause possible damage.<br />Negatives: When you receive this heli GLUE THE TAIL MOTOR MOUNT DOWN TO THE BOOM!  If you crash tail first into the wall the mount will slide forward and shear the wires off (yes I did it before).  I wish the quality of motor was better, the one you see I replaced both motors, it is the oldest heli I have however (I have 3).  The amount of plastic in the rotor causes the flight characteristics to change and frequent trimming.  The drive gear will be ruined quickly without  killing the power before a crash.<br />Tips: Glue the tail motor mount down.  Kill the power before a crash and don\\'t let it flop around on the floor.  I would say 6-7 years old to fly this without destroying it.  I would order:  main drive gears, balance bars and main blades.  I have not broken the tail blades yet.  There are great kits with everything besides the motors for around $10 including all the usual broken parts plus a new canopy and skids.  The main drive gear I had to order individually.  Don\\'t overhead the motors too badly, they may begin to turn slowly and have to be replaced, warm not hot.<br />Have fun!\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"Although this is not an “official” Pok&eacute;mon product, this Umbreon plush is no doubt the biggest, cutest, softest, and BEST Umbreon available! It “purr-fectly” depicts this beautiful lunar black cat, just as he looks in the Pok&eacute;mon games, with vivid colours, and spot-on accurate details.<br /><br />You will not find a single identifying tag on this plush (no hang tag or tush tag), as it is a custom pattern based directly on the awesome TakaraTomy small Umbreon ([[ASIN:B00A84G21E Takaratomy Pokemon N-47 Umbreon/Blacky Best Wishes 8&#34; Plush Doll]]) plush pattern (I have attached photos to compare the two) – only expanded to two times the size! It is a perfect replica of the real Umbreon, accurately designed, and not one detail is missing.<br /><br />This Umbreon is very lifelike, and large – approximately 13 inches tall! He sits up on his own, excellently balanced, without any need for extra support, so you can easily display him on a bed, shelf, desk, or anywhere you would like.<br /><br />The materials used to make this plush are high-quality. Like other reviewers mentioned, this Umbreon special in that the material used to make his fur is actually jet-black instead of the more grayish-black-looking shades used on some of the other Umbreon plushies by TakaraTomy and Banpresto. The black &#34;fur&#34; is also very soft and velvety to the touch. The circular golden markings on his forehead and legs are precisely embroidered with shiny bright yellow thread, and his catlike red eyes with slit pupils (also masterfully embroidered onto the face), are piercing and intense, true to the real Umbreon. He has a short feline muzzle with a tiny triangular black nose, and a cute little grin (although these details are somewhat difficult to see at first, as they blend in with his jet-black fur). All over, his figure is perfect and accurate! He is stuffed to purr-fection, and although he is very lithe in shape, he is super-soft, squishy, and very cuddly. His rabbit-like ears are stuffed thickly, so they stand upright do not flop, and they have beautiful golden yellow ring patterns around them.  The tail is the same, constructed and well-stuffed, just like the ears. His feline paws and feet are very beautifully detailed, with digits sewn in.

There are only four flaps in the transformation, but it\\'s pretty cool in its simplicity.<br /><br />There is a battery that does sound effects, and the sound effects are actually pretty cool. There is a switch where you can turn the effects off, 1/3rd level sound, or full sound. It comes with a AAA battery included, and it starts out on the reduced sound setting. So, that way your kid doesn\\'t get used to loud sounds coming from this right from the box. At first, I thought that the sound was broken, because it\\'s so slight, but this is pretty awesome that you get to choose different levels.<br /><br />There are two red sound buttons that you can press for different sound effects, and it makes different effects based on whether it\\'s a dinosaur or if it\\'s a car. So, overall there are about twenty different sound effects, which is a ton for a toy like this.<br /><br />This is one of those cars that you can push a few times, and the wheels will keep spinning. Then you drop it on the floor, and it goes. At first, I thought that the battery would help propel it, but the battery is just for sound effects. There\\'s a rev engine inside that you have to charge by pushing it on the ground a few times before you release it.\"\\n',\n",

My son really wanted a Darth Maul so I bought this set, which was half the price of a Lego Darth Maul figure, and he is thrilled.  Takes a bit more work because you do have to pretty much assemble each figure from scratch.  So you can buy these eight figures for under $7 or you can buy a fully assembled single Lego figure for about $15 to $20 (one of the Darth Mauls is $30).  So, it depends on whether you have more time or money.  Took me about 10 minutes to put them all together.  But, you don\\'t get a box, which was someone\\'s complaint that gave this a one-star review.  Yeah.  Right.  A box.  That I\\'m going to throw away.  Oh, and a hint.  3-CPO comes with a light saber for some reason.  If you look at Darth Maul\\'s light saber handle, there\\'s a spot on both ends for a saber beam.  Take CPOs beam and stick it in Darth Maul\\'s handle and, tada, the infamous double-bladed light saber!  CPO never had a light saber anyway.  Jeez.\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"I honestly can\\'t stop using this, even just going back and forth around the hallways in my house is so much fun.<br /><br />Yes, it looks a lot like a Segwey without handles, and that\\'s pretty much exactly what it is. But it\\'s even harder to get used to at first, because it feels so unnatural to lean forward or backward on something with only two wheels, and you don\\'t even have handles as a safety blanket. But you really don\\'t need them. You just have to learn to trust the device and ignore your brain\\'s nagging about how it\\'s going to make you fall over.<br /><br />There is absolutely no assembly, so setting it up consists only of charging the batter, which is included, internal, and non-replaceable. This takes about an hour. But on a full charge, it has a decent amount of life in it. Between zooming around my house, and around my neighborhood sidewalks for over an hour, it was still going strong.<br /><br />It also includes LEDs on the front of each foot, which are kind of nice although not really necessary. They help light your way a little bit, but if it was too dark to see without them, I\\'d still probably recommend against using it in the first place.<br /><br />Although the LEDs kind of suggest which way is front and back, you can actually face either direction and the device will operate identically either way.<br /><br />Actual usage is as simple as: angle each foot forward or backward depending on how fast you want to go. So if you lean both feet forward, you\\'ll start going forward. If you have your right foot going backward, and left foot forward, you\\'ll rotate clockwise. It is capable of going much faster than I even dare going, so while I couldn\\'t get myself to max out its speed, I can definitely attest to it being very fast for what it is.<br /><br />The trickiest thing about using it is going over bumps or cracks. Due to how it works, and how small the wheels are, even small bumps and cracks can be very disruptive. If any part of it leaves the ground for any period of time, it has a harder time detecting how much pressure each foot is pressing on it, making it unpredictable. So I would strongly advise using it in as flat and smooth of area as possible.<br /><br />So basically, once you get past the initial learning phase, this becomes extremely fun as long as you keep it in a tame area without too many obstructions. I literally just hop on and off of it randomly throughout the day to zip around my kitchen and halls just for fun. Very addictive and unique way to travel!<br /><br />*Pros*<br />[+] Works fantastically, self-balancing is spot-on<br />[+] Comes completely assembled so it is super easy to set up<br />[+] Batter life is much better than I anticipated<br />[+] It\\'s surprisingly silent, even while traveling at high speeds<br />[+] Gets a lot of attention from onlookers simply due to its uniqueness and awesomeness<br />[+] Can go very fast!

If you can count to ten in order, you pretty much have all the skill required to play.  That makes the game pretty open to all ages, although 9 or 10 would probably be the younger limit to be able to enjoy playing the game.  Playing a card moves one of your pieces across the board, and every spot on the board has a point value.<br /><br />There are two basic versions on how to play, the short game and the long game.  Short games are basically one round and take a bit more than 20 minutes, and the long games basically are three rounds of the game and take a bit more than an hour.  There are other variations you can add on top of that, and with all board games you can always make your own house rules.  For us, we enjoyed playing it where the tiles on the game board were not flipped over until a player’s piece landed on that spot—we felt that added to the exploration theme of the game and made it more fun for us, but that’s just one example.<br /><br />Game board, card and pieces are all high quality and well made.  They should last a very long time with normal gameplay.<br /><br />While simple, we found the game fun and very approachable.  It’s easily a top choice for a casual game night with friends and family.\"\\n',\n",

Purchasing the Inductrix was the result of such help.<br /><br />Been into RC stuff for decades but exclusively cars and trucks.  Came across a link to a tiny little Estes Proto X and thought &#34;well thats kinda cool&#34; and ran out and bought the little bugger after watching some youtube videos which made it look super easy to fly...  Same with the Blade Nano QX 3D which I also purchased based on the reviews and videos on youtube which went ON AND ON about how easy they are to fly...  DON\\'T BELIEVE IT!  Easy is all relative...<br /><br />SO, I get home all excited, charge up my new little Quads ready to launch into a new Hobby filled with precision flying and cat chasing.  However, this is was not the case.  Instead I spent a good portion of my day trying to put tiny little rotors back onto the Estes Proto X and pushing motors back onto the motor mounts of the 3D...  Some decent level flight was had, but not much, mostly I just spent my time putting them back together.  It reminded me of a similarly doomed venture a few years ago with RC Helicopters, which ended with me giving away radios, batteries, chargers, and yes Helicopters.  Turns out Skill with driving, riding, and video games does NOT translate into rotary wing aircraft.<br /><br />ALL OF WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE INDUCTRIX.  I was hesitant to buy the Inductrix, after all I had two frustrating quads at home already with STEEP learning curves, wasn\\'t interested in adding more frustration.  Felt as though my MAN CARD was already in jeopardy.  However, as the radio to the QX 3D will bind with the Inductrix I took the Clerks advice at HobbyTown and purchased one.<br /><br />WOOHOO!  Success, finally a Quad rotor that doesn\\'t shatter or shed rotors at every misstep, a quad that seems to WANT to fly and work with me to improve or actually develop quad skills.  The Inductrix is STABLE, and perfect for someone who is a complete noob.  It\\'s quiet by comparison to the others and a great way to tiptoe into the whole drone/Quad thing.  Decent run time, inexpensive batteries, and a truly solid performer.  It\\'s allowed me to establish true 5-8 minute flight times without terrorizing the cats, or shredding parts, very cool.<br /><br />So, if you are New to RC flight do not hesitate, this thing is excellent, it\\'s stable fun and follows directions better than the Estes Proto X, and Blade Nano QX 3D.  However if you are NOT new then I might hesitate and all of this quads stability and lack of &#34;tricks&#34; might make it kind of boring for you.is STABLE, and perfect for someone who is a complete noob.

       " '\"I stumbled across this by accident, and although it seemed a bit pricey for only being able to make 10 images, I thought this would be a fun project for my grand-daughter (age 9) to work on over the summer. I guess these kits have been around for a long time, but somehow I never knew about them...I think they are a great idea, and I had fun, too! Easy directions are on the back of the package. The kit is simple: inside of the package is the paper in a protective dark pack--don\\'t let light hit the paper when taking out one sheet! and a thick piece of acrylic to hold the objects to be printed flat--there is an adhesive sheet protecting it that needs to be discarded first. We simply laid a large, flat piece of cardboard on the lawn in a spot where there was full sun. For the first picture, she made a simple design from pieces of torn paper to make a floral pattern...she put the print paper on the cardboard, arranged her design on top, and covered it with the acrylic. It took about two minutes for the light blue paper to turn white and then she just popped it into a dishpan full of clean water--I know now that it is best to change the water after every one or two pictures--and it slowly turned a dark blue, and ta-daa! There was the image! Pretty! From there, she tried 3-D objects (without the acrylic sheet, of course) and the one that turned out the best was a branch with fruit--the detail and depth came out great! I didn\\'t see any refills available for the same size paper (about 8 x 10) but I was able to order a couple of 5 x 7 packs, so lots of opportunity to make more Sun Prints! I think this is a great kit for elementary school age kids (and I\\'m sure older kids could come up with some pretty creative uses, too) but for more than one child, with only 10 sheets, I think it would be best to have a refill on hand. In fact, if kids want to make Sun Prints with 3-D objects, the kit isn\\'t needed at all, just save some money & purchase the paper by itself!\"\\n',\n",

She stands about 6&#34; from the base to the highest tip of her hair. One thing that isn\\'t too clear from most pictures is that she does have a slanted fetal pose rather than an upright one. This allows her to be displayed very well from her left side (or straight-on), but her right side isn\\'t really an option because of the angle -- a potentially important consideration for your display configuration.<br /><br />There is some minor assembly required; she comes in 4 pieces: Head/hair, body, coral/rock, and the actual black base itself. Since the coral\\'s peg cannot be fully inserted except in the proper position, there\\'s no way to assemble her incorrectly.<br /><br />Overall, I\\'d say you couldn\\'t possibly ask for a better figure at this price point, especially considering how expensive other Princess Shirahoshi figures are.

       " '\"Although this is not an “official” Pok&eacute;mon product, this Umbreon plush is no doubt the biggest, cutest, softest, and BEST Umbreon available! It “purr-fectly” depicts this beautiful lunar black cat, just as he looks in the Pok&eacute;mon games, with vivid colours, and spot-on accurate details.<br /><br />You will not find a single identifying tag on this plush (no hang tag or tush tag), as it is a custom pattern based directly on the awesome TakaraTomy small Umbreon ([[ASIN:B00A84G21E Takaratomy Pokemon N-47 Umbreon/Blacky Best Wishes 8&#34; Plush Doll]]) plush pattern (I have attached photos to compare the two) – only expanded to two times the size! It is a perfect replica of the real Umbreon, accurately designed, and not one detail is missing.<br /><br />This Umbreon is very lifelike, and large – approximately 13 inches tall! He sits up on his own, excellently balanced, without any need for extra support, so you can easily display him on a bed, shelf, desk, or anywhere you would like.<br /><br />The materials used to make this plush are high-quality. Like other reviewers mentioned, this Umbreon special in that the material used to make his fur is actually jet-black instead of the more grayish-black-looking shades used on some of the other Umbreon plushies by TakaraTomy and Banpresto. The black &#34;fur&#34; is also very soft and velvety to the touch. The circular golden markings on his forehead and legs are precisely embroidered with shiny bright yellow thread, and his catlike red eyes with slit pupils (also masterfully embroidered onto the face), are piercing and intense, true to the real Umbreon. He has a short feline muzzle with a tiny triangular black nose, and a cute little grin (although these details are somewhat difficult to see at first, as they blend in with his jet-black fur). All over, his figure is perfect and accurate! He is stuffed to purr-fection, and although he is very lithe in shape, he is super-soft, squishy, and very cuddly. His rabbit-like ears are stuffed thickly, so they stand upright do not flop, and they have beautiful golden yellow ring patterns around them.  The tail is the same, constructed and well-stuffed, just like the ears. His feline paws and feet are very beautifully detailed, with digits sewn in. His lovely detailed front paws are sewn together by thick threads, and I would not advise separating them, as it might result in damaging the plush.<br /><br />Being an Eeveelution fanatic and cat lover, I adore Umbreon (as well has his Psychic-type sister, Espeon), and could not be more delighted with this incredible plush. He is one of my top favourites, and is always there for me to cuddle. He is perfect to snuggle with; hugging a soft plushie comforts me and helps me sleep, and this Umbreon has become one of my main cuddle buddies. I call him &#34;Phantom&#34;. :)<br /><br />I ordered this beautiful extra-large Umbreon plush from a very kind and honest seller on eBay. These extra-large Eeveelution plushies are made in and sold from China, so it will take some time to ship, but it is worth the wait. Again, this is not an official Nintendo plush, but in my personal opinion it is actually better and more fairly priced than any official Umbreon plush currently available.

I say &#34;children&#34; because adults will love the cars just as much as 8 year olds.<br /><br />First off, you need a smartphone or other smart device to serve as the remote.  For full compatibility list, visit www.wowweezone.com.  But more recent iPhones and Android devices are included in the list.<br /><br />With the smartphone or device, you can choose the game that you want the cars to play and choose how and when they shoot each other and which weapons they use.  You\\'ll also need 8 AA batteries.  I suggest that you use rechargeable batteries.  I tend to recharge the car batteries when I recharge my cell phone, and I haven\\'t run into low batteries at inopportune times by following that routine.<br /><br />You end up controlling one of the cars and the other car automatically responds to the car you\\'re controlling.  It\\'s like a live video game.  So you don\\'t need to control the second car yourself.  I read that GPS tracking technology allows the second car to follow the first.  Not only does the second car follow the first, but it shoots at it and tries to &#34;destroy&#34; it.  So you need to make sure that your car wins the game.<br /><br />You can play the game on any floor surface.  The cars, though, move fastest on smoother surfaces.  Luckily, they didn\\'t scratch my floors.<br /><br />Finally, you can buy accessories--if you want.  You can buy ramps.  You can also buy additional cars.  I read that you can have up to 50 cars playing the game at once.  I\\'m not exactly sure how that works, though.\"\\n',\n",

Miles from Tomorrowland is an animated space adventure series. It centers on the Callisto family who live on a spaceship called the Stellosphere and work for the Tomorrowland Transit Authority (TTA).<br /><br />From the description, &#34;The Stellosphere comes apart into 3 separate ships to make space explorations easier. Open up the large Stellosphere playset to reveal the Callisto\\'s command center where Miles and the Callisto Family (figures sold separately) can receive missions from the TTA. For short, quick missions, take the mini StarJetter that is stored in the Stellosphere. For longer missions that require a greater distance to travel take the Zip Ship that can be removed from the top of the Stellosphere. To boost any ship with lights and sounds remove the XVR system from the bottom of the Stellosphere and attach to the other ships.&#34;<br /><br />First, the Stellosphere requires 3 AAA batteries which are included.<br />There is one poseable Miles figure included.  Miles is an enthusiastic and curious boy with a somewhat reckless inventive streak whom the series is named after.<br /><br />The Stellosphere has a lot of features.  It has lights and sounds plus phrases from &#34;Miles from Tomorrowland&#34;.<br />I think this is a really fun and imaginative concept - the ability to detach the ships is a great feature, especially when multiple kids are playing.<br /><br />I am very happy with all aspects of this item.<br />There is a play set of other figures but they are stuck to little platforms and not as poseable as Miles from this set.  Other action figures from this series do fit / match.  There are also companion toys that go with this Stratosphere for the real Miles fan.\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"I have the authentic version of this plush, since I bought it on the Pokemon Center USA website. I usually don\\'t mind bootlegs, but the bootleg version of the Pokemon Center Espeon Poke Plush has a lopsided head unlike the one that I have. Espeon is my favorite Eeveeloution alongside Sylveon, Leafeon and Umbreon, and I thought that having a average size Espeon plush that\\'s larger than the unofficial Espeon Poke Doll would be a wonderful gift for me, She looks just like a nekotama cat from Japanese mythology and folklore, and even more cute!<br /><br />This Espeon plush is adorable and beautiful simultaneously. The wonderful purple/lilac minky fabric used to make her is luxuriously soft like every Pokemon Center licensed Pokemon plush! She\\'s structured very well, even better than every other Espeon plush ever made.(The Kuttari Cuties Espeon plush, both awake and asleep forms, are ridiculously adorable too!) The stitching and shaping is satisfactory, and deserves an A+!<br /><br />Also, if you want an authentic version of this plush instead of a bootleg one, you could possibly be out of luck. They are very rare to find and if you are lucky enough to find one, they are ridiculously expensive. Sadly, bootleg Pokemon plushies are a lot cheaper than the authentic ones.<br /><br />If you ever get this plush, you should get her lunar counterpart, Umbreon, to go along with her. Even a Sylveon would go good with this plush too. This is definitely my No.1 favorite Eeveeloution in sweet and huggable plush form! Any Eeveeloution fan will be happy!\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"When I walked into my LHS which has a large off road track, I asked the guy behind the counter about what would be fun to run behind my house and competitive at the track. Being a newbie to the RC world I wasn\\'t looking to spend alot of money. They had some less expensive short course trucks and naturally asked about them first. He told me if I was just looking to bash in the backyard the 200$ SC they sold would be a great truck, if I was looking to race then the Team Associated SC10RS would be a better choice. The guy said he been doing RC for 30 years. I asked if I bought this could I just drop it on the track and be competitive? He assured me I could.  My brother and I both bought this truck that day, his the Rock Star/Makita version mine this very Toyota. We raced with them stock a week later and even though we were complete noobs we still placed better than last against guys running hopped up losi\\'s and 200$ transmitters. After some rigorous practice and new tires that better fit the track, i\\'m now running mid pack, slowly moving up every week, well my brother has taken 2 first place finishes in the 3 weeks we\\'ve raced.  I\\'m confident with time I\\'ll be in the front of the pack and my truck is not what is holding me back. I catch everyone in the straight and can turn as tight as anything out there. I run 5300ma 40C lipo batteries. I recommend  at least 40 C battery as this car definitely shows an improvement in punch on the 40c over a 30c battery. Running less than a 30c battery will overstress the battery and definitely effect performance. The guy at the shop said more than a 40c battery won\\'t show a performance boost or a very  negligible one. Sounds believable since he make more if he sold me a more expensive higher C battery.  As far as durability is concerned ive smashed this thing in every way conceivable. I did manage to rip the rear A arm off after about 4 weeks of running this thing to the hilt, and the lexon body cracked alot in the rear, but some gorilla tape fixed that right up. The rear A arms at my local track were only 7$ a set for the OEM ones. Besides that this thing has taken a beating and kept going. I\\'ve cycled multiple batteries through it in a row with out cool down time. The motor hasn\\'t shown any loss of performance. I try to let it cool down now between runs since talking to experienced guys who told me running more than 10 minutes straight can damage a RC motor. The 5300ma lipos Batteries last easily 20+ minutes running close to wide open or wide open about 50% of the time on the track. The battery cut off has always left 6+ volts in my pack. I definitely wouldn\\'t want to run them any lower since everything I\\'ve read online says 6V is OK but theirs alot of debate about anything lower and most agree its probably damaging your pack going lower.  The stock shell does suffer from &#34;parachuting&#34; when going off large jumps. Since the track I run on is set up for 1/8 buggy and truggy both electric and nitro the jumps are huge. You can hit most of them but it takes precise lining up and getting hard on the throttle as soon as possible. The truck is light enough that even though it\\'s only rear wheel drive you do have a fair amount of control using the throttle and brake to adjust your angle mid air. Assuming that a strong wind doesn\\'t come along and flip you over mid air or cause you too levitate. From what I\\'ve seen everyone either cuts holes in their body or most just use flo tech bodies to negate this issue. The stock body seems fine as long as its not windy, it is very predictable.  At the last race I went to it had rained hard for a few hours prior to race start. The track was muddy and not just regular mud but muddy clay. Durring qualifying my truck started having serious performance issues and at one point I watched it come through a left turn and as it rolled out I noticed the front left wheel dipped deep into the chassis at the apex of the corner. I thought I had blown a shock. After the race I picked up my car and it weighed nearly twice its normal weight. The entire inside of the shell and the rest of the truck from the rear end through the front suspension was caked in mud. The fan on the esc was even burried and not spinning. Well I cleaned it out with brushs the best I could but I still felt it was heavier than it should be. The fan came back to life though. On my 2nd race I noticed it still was not performing as well as it should and caked up again before it was over. So this time I just took it over to the hose and sprayed the whole truck out. Yeah I\\'m nuts, but you know what I let it dry till the next heat, popped a battery in it and it still worked like nothing happened. I took care not to spray directly into seals on the rear end, electronics, and survo. I\\'m not saying that you should hose your car right out like I did but I am saying that I did it and the car didn\\'t skip a beat.  I can\\'t say that I have alot of experience with short course trucks, the only other truck I have is a hpi Blitz that I got a great deal on used. I can tell you though from my experience this sc10RS has hop ups from the factory that are needed and none that it doesn\\'t. It has aluminum shocks and a brushless motor which everyone agrees if you have a standard sc10 are 2 of the first things you should get. The survo in it is also fairly strong, and quick. It\\'s not the most amazing thing you can buy but from what I\\'ve learned from other SC guys is it is the best survo that comes in any brand SC RTR. Also the transmitter, will not a 100$ or 200$ unit does feel smooth and has all the adjustment knobs you need. Mine came with the new style with the knobs on top so did my brothers. Also like I said earlier, my brother is running this thing full stock (minus tires) and that includes the transmitter and is laying a hurting on guys with mush more expensive equipment.  The only downside I\\'ve really seen with this truck is its transmission is loud compared to the blitz which hasfull metal gears and is filled with gear oil. The sc10s gears are mostly plastic and only runs a semi sealed designed. I don\\'t believe this was done to save cost. The blitz weighs considerably more because of that full metal tranny which effects everything from acceleration to how will it jumps. I\\'ve had zero problems with the rear end in the sc10 and I beat on it as hard as I want. So plastic gears or not they hold up well. This is just a well built racer using metal only where it is absolutely crucial for durability. The only thing I upgraded were the wheel hexes in the back to aluminum ones. I chewed up my plastic ones running with the wheels lose and not realizing it. They also make wheel changing easier cause they lock onto the axle where as the plastic ones were only held in place by the wheel and tended to get stuck in the rim when the wheel was removed. It\\'s a hop up for convenience more than anything and adds very little weight.  Oh and I should mention the esc will come loose on you if you run this thing hard as you should. The factory applied double sided tape is garbage. We bought scotch brand double sided outdoor rated tape and nothing has broken loose since. We also use it for our transponders. Get that and some gorrilla tape for reinforcing the shell if it cracks and you\\'ll be all set.\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"Bought her from Good Smile Company.<br /><br />After many delays, Figma Lucina has finally been released! Was she worth the wait? But before we jump to that conclusion, let\\'s take a look at the Figma. Since amazon gets weird with reviews with pictures attached to it, I will upload them later once my this review gets officially uploaded.<br /><br />Edit: 9/11/2015 Added photos for the review. For those of you who are curious about the collab pics, I used Saber 2.0 with Dress Saber\\'s smiling face, Yukiko, Hana, and Ranko. All of them are Figmas as well. I corrected her height; she is 5 inches long, not 8.<br /><br />Edit: 9/17/2015 I removed duplicate photos. For some reason, amazon uploaded each image twice.<br /><br />Lucina is around 5 inches/140mm tall without the use of a stand and comes with a Figma bag, and stand with adapter. Her accessories are:<br />-Blushing face<br />-Short haired head piece<br />-Bangs with her buttefly mask<br />-Falchion<br />-Falchion grip<br />-7 hands<br /><br />The figure is plain, but gorgeous. The blue of her tunic, contrasted with the white folds of her boots, the gold stripes along the side, and the red underside of her cape makes her easy on the eyes. Most of the figure is textured with a nice, soft, matte finish. Couple her colors with her slender frame and she really is a beauty. Her hair looks pretty good too and they did a good job of capturing the shagginess of it. If you look closely, you can see the division of her bob and the rest of her hair. Her cape is very well done, with a lot of folds and waves to give it shape and definition. The cape splits down the middle and is attached to her scarf with joints so it can rotate. The cape attaches to her back with the help of a housing and a plug. Simply align the housing to the hole and insert the plug. It\\'s very much like Figma Nadeko and her jacket. The scarf is simple, with the House of Ylisse insignia on the front, and it even has a curled up hoody. Her fan favorite blusing face is probably my favorite. She looks very cute with it. It looks like GSC removed the blush but from what I can see, it\\'s still there but it\\'s very subtle. Another detail that GSC didn\\'t over look is her Brand of the Exalt. If you look at her left eye, you\\'ll see that it\\'s there. Lastly, Lucina has a really nice butt. I\\'m not kidding. For some reason, the &#34;underwear&#34; looks roomy and shapely and if you look at her butt from a certain height, it looks like it\\'s bursting out of her tunic. I think this is to give her legs more space to move around.<br /><br />Now I want to move on to her face. I like it but something seems off. It\\'s like they couldn\\'t decide which style they wanted to use so they combined Lucina\\'s round, long face from the cutscenes and used her narrower eyes from her in-game portrait. I sort of wished they gave more color to her lips. Also, a lot of people are commenting about Lucina\\'s blushing face. GSC has announced that it is a quality control issue. Some faces have blush and some don\\'t. You can contact them because I\\'ve heard GSC sending in spare face plates.<br /><br />Lucina\\'s pauldrons can be removed and they do tend to wobble a bit. She comes with an extra hair piece and that one has the mask.<br />Note, you can remove the mask if you want to use it as a prop but it\\'s glued to her hair but with some picking, you can take it off.<br />The resulting hair piece will have the indentations where the ends of the mask were. She also has her leather straps to hold her<br />Falchion. The straps can\\'t be removed and the main furl of it is glued to her back. I don\\'t recommend taking it off. Her cuffs can be rotated but can\\'t be taken off.<br /><br />Articulation is decent. While her arms can\\'t bend more than 45 degress, her legs have good movement, being able to bend 30 degress back, and she is capable of doing a split! This is good because even though her tunic does somewhat obstruct her legs, it\\'s soft enough the it can bend with the legs w/o much resistance. Her arms sockets are decent enough that she\\'s able to wield her sword with two hands with ease. Also, since her hips aren\\'t attached to anything, she tends to center herself like Saber 2.0 but at least she can hold certain poses. For the foot, she has a decent ankle rocker. Her foot rotates from the center which looks kind of funky. This is because the cup of her boots gets in the way of her leg. She does not have a toe joint.<br /><br />Now for the figure itself. Mine has some weird imperfections but nothing major. There are some paint transfers on her right pauldron, visible scratches and chips on her left arm, and the left side of her bangs don\\'t go in all the way, but you\\'d have to look pretty closely to see the imperfections, and I personally like the scratches because I think it gives the figure some character and they\\'re visible in such a way that it looks like she got into a fight and got a few scratches rather than someone fouling up with the paint. Also, mine tilts a bit to the left. It looks like one of her legs is either longer than the other or the legs aren\\'t fitted right.<br /><br />On to the drawbacks. Her Falchion can not be sheathed. Instead, her Falchion grip attaches to the sheath with a peg. If it doesn\\'t fit into the sheath, try flipping it because the grip\\'s peg is shaped. Putting on the sword can be tricky because the grip is so big and you kind of have to pull out Lucy\\'s fingers to get it so be careful! The ends of her boots look a little janky. It makes it look like she\\'s wearing very ornate leggings while also wearing giant, collared slippers. She lacks a decent battle face. While her default expression is versatile, it lacks the impact of a real angry face. I guess it\\'s because they based her expressions from her CG portraits but they could have tried. Her long hair variant looks odd w/o the cape because it looks like it\\'s just floating in mid air. Plus you\\'ll notice that the body of her hair has a different shade of blue compared to her side curls so it does look somewhat odd. Not only that, Lucina\\'s head articulation is strictly limited with the cape on because it hits the furl of her cape. Further more, having the cape on also limits her arm articulation when raising the arms because the pauldron hits her scarf.<br /><br />To be honest, I\\'m somewhat mixed when I got the figure. Part of me was saying, &#34;Finally! Best girl is here! ******* HYPE!&#34; and another part of me is saying, &#34;Hmmm. This is it?&#34; After many delays and a high price made me feel disappointed but after playing with the figure for a bit and seeing how gorgeous it is, I thought she was worth it in the end. If you\\'re a Fire Emblem Awakening fan, and if you have the money I would recommend buying Lucina. Barely. She\\'s already hitting the $100 mark, $30 more than what I payed for including S&H. If you\\'re just a casual collector and you like buying &#34;sword girls&#34; I\\'d recommend you save your money for the time being.<br /><br />Knowing what happened to Figma Link and Figma Samus, I would not be surprised if Figma Lucy got a re-release.ce her hips aren\\'t attached to anything, she tends to center herself like Saber 2.0 but at least she can hold certain poses. For the foot, she has a decent ankle rocker. Her foot rotates from the center which looks kind of funky. This is because the cup of her boots gets in the way of her leg. She does not have a toe joint.  Now for the figure itself. Mine has some weird imperfections but nothing major. There are some paint transfers on her right pauldron, visible scratches and chips on her left arm, and the left side of her bangs don\\'t go in all the way, but you\\'d have to look pretty closely to see the imperfections, and I personally like the scratches because I think it gives the figure some character and they\\'re visible in such a way that it looks like she got into a fight and got a few scratches rather than someone fouling up with the paint. Also, mine tilts a bit to the left. It looks like one of her legs is either longer than the other or the legs aren\\'t fitted right.  On to the drawbacks. Her Falchion can not be sheathed. Instead, her Falchion grip attaches to the sheath with a peg. If it doesn\\'t fit into the sheath, try flipping it because the grip\\'s peg is shaped. Putting on the sword can be tricky because the grip is so big and you kind of have to pull out Lucy\\'s fingers to get it so be careful! The ends of her boots look a little janky. It makes it look like she\\'s wearing very ornate leggings while also wearing giant, collared slippers. She lacks a decent battle face. While her default expression is versatile, it lacks the impact of a real angry face. I guess it\\'s because they based her expressions from her CG portraits but they could have tried. Her long hair variant looks odd w/o the cape because it looks like it\\'s just floating in mid air. Plus you\\'ll notice that the body of her hair has a different shade of blue compared to her side curls so it does look somewhat odd. Not only that, Lucina\\'s head articulation is strictly limited with the cape on because it hits the furl of her cape. Further more, having the cape on also limits her arm articulation when raising the arms because the pauldron hits her scarf.  To be honest, I\\'m somewhat mixed when I got the figure. Part of me was saying, &#34;Finally! Best girl is here! ******* HYPE!&#34; and another part of me is saying, &#34;Hmmm. This is it?&#34; After many delays and a high price made me feel disappointed but after playing with the figure for a bit and seeing how gorgeous it is, I thought she was worth it in the end. If you\\'re a Fire Emblem Awakening fan, and if you have the money I would recommend buying Lucina. Barely. She\\'s already hitting the $100 mark, $30 more than what I payed for including S&H.

       " '\"Just as a preface for this review, I\\'m completely biased in favour of this kit. It had been one that struck my fancy months ago and I finally had the opportunity to acquire one for a decent price.<br /><br />Starting off, the biggest allure of this kit is the Super Deformed to \\'Real Mode\\' transformation. Most of the time, kits have to suffer a lot in terms of design and functionality to facilitate the gimmick. In all fairness, Haganemaru does take a bit of a hit in those departments, namely in the leg area. That being said, he does have an impressive shelf presence in a more static pose; that is to say that he stands out as an interesting addition. The weapons are pretty underwhelming though, not a whole lot to talk about there.<br /><br />As far as genuinely not-good things on this kit go, the only thing I can really think of are two extraneous pieces on his back that don\\'t really serve a purpose in either mode. They just exist to fill up space from the look of things, which is an odd choice. In the SD mode, there\\'s really nothing keeping them in place other than gravity. Then comes the issue of the colours. Scratchbuilt and unpainted with just the stickers, this kit is going to be lacking quite a bit of detail, but that\\'s commonplace for many SDs. Be careful about painting, though. Being an older SD kit, the kind of plastic this guy is made out of is a bit tricky to paint, some acrylics don\\'t particularly want to bond to it all that much.<br /><br />While this kit does have a fair number of problems going for it, I find myself looking past them whenever I look over to my shelf and see it. It\\'s just such a nifty concept and it was executed so much better than other attempts at the same thing, there\\'s no reason to not love him. None of his modes look bad, they just might be a little lacking here or there. What is doesn\\'t quite live up to in design choices it more than makes up for in far more style than most other kits could ever dream of having.\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"My 2 year old son loves this set.  Of course he loves anything with a ball and this has 2 lol! It is not very tall and is perfect for smaller children (for reference he is 36” tall).  It ia lightweight which he loves because he can move it by himself to wherever he wants to play and it is compact enough that it can be used indoors (perfect for our continual rainy weather lately)<br /><br />The frame is super easy to put together ( my 9 year old put it together in just a few minutes looking at the pictures).  The net however was a little more challenging and honestly, I am not sure my hubby has it on exactly the way it was designed, but it works and our son was so excited to play with it that he could not wait for us to redo it.  You really have to put the frame together, see how the net goes on, take it back apart and add the net.  Fortunately, the pieces are super easy to put together and take apart.  The instructions do not have any words, but are a series of sketches showing it put together.  The only part of the frame construction that was hazy to me  was whether the medium sized tubes go down the sides or along the bottom – they go down the sides.<br /><br />If you are wanting it to be more permanent, you can put a little super glue on the connectors but we wanted to be able to store it which is part of its appeal (it takes up very little real estate when disassembled).  Also, it is slightly top heavy so a weight on the back can help it from tipping over during play.<br /><br />It comes with 2 balls that are deflated and an air pin for inflating them.  At first, I was disappointed because I thought you needed a pump to blow them up but my husband discovered that you can simply inflate them by putting the provided pin in and blowing.<br /><br />This has been a really fun toy that my son loves and I am grateful to have been able to purchase it at a discount in exchange for my honest opinions.\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"Truly a great game. If you like Dominion then you will LOVE this. This is a better and more diverse game than Dominion.  Instead of dealing with all of those Green Point cards and the Currency cards, everything you need is on every unit (Mercenary) card that you purchase from the playing field. They all add resources that help you gather more units for your Clan/Tribe/Group.  Another GREAT denamic that this game has to offer is at the end of each turn there is a &#34;Skirmish&#34; phase where you dedicated some troops to fight over a &#34;Contended&#34; or &#34;rare&#34; item. Everyone participates if they choose, and again they use the units/mercenaries to battle. Each one has it\\'s own attack value.  The expansions add so much more, and SO much more replay value. For example you can now have a &#34;Leader&#34; card that makes your whole Clan/Tribe/Group unique, and adds a lot of diversity every game.

       " '\"This is the first drone I\\'ve ever used. It\\'s light and fairly inexpensive, so I feel it\\'s a great one to learn on. If you screw up, it\\'s not as big of a deal as if you destroy a five hundred dollar drone.<br /><br />There is a small amount of assembly required, but it\\'s not too bad, and only takes a few minutes. First, you\\'ll want to start fully charging one of the two included batteries. While that\\'s charging, you can put on the wings, wing guards, and feet. Everything is very easily attached and screwed on with the included screwdriver, which is very nice because I hate needing to find one the perfect size (screws are very tiny).<br /><br />The camera just slides onto the bottom and has a small wire that connects to a port on the bottom. The controller requires AA batteries, which aren\\'t included, so make sure you have some ready.<br /><br />After about an hour, the battery should be fully charged. I really like that it charges via USB since it\\'s so universal, and it means you can charge a battery easily on-the-go with one of the several USB power banks I have. However, there is no &#34;fully charged&#34; indicator light, so you just have to guess. There is an indicator that the charger is connected to the battery, but nothing to let you know it\\'s charging, or charged, which is unusual.<br /><br />So batteries are charged and installed now, drone assembled, all that\\'s left is to get the app. I found it pretty easily. It did take a few minutes to figure out how to sync it to the actual camera. You\\'ll need to change to the drone\\'s wifi network while it is powered on, then you can start the remote viewing. It\\'s pretty cool, but definitely a far cry from being GoPro quality. You can\\'t adjust the aim, so while I would prefer it to aim downward, it only aims forward. The field of view is wide and a pretty decent quality though. I really enjoyed flying the drone more than bothering with the camera, so after a few minutes of playing with it, I ended up just disconnecting the camera to take some weight off the drone, making it slightly more agile.<br /><br />Flying the thing does have a small learning curve if you are like me and haven\\'t flied one before. After crashing it a few times and stress testing it at all speeds and angles, I feel pretty confident in my piloting abilities after an hour or so of use.<br /><br />The first thing I would suggest doing is using the adjustment buttons on the remote to make it fly as straight and level as possible. Mine went slightly southeast by default, but was able to get it very stable with the compensation buttons.<br /><br />With all that out of the way, I have to just get to the verdict, which is this is a BLAST to fly. It\\'s fast and maneuverable, and not too difficult to control after some practice. The propeller colors and LEDs on the bottom of the unit help you keep track of which way is forward. Sadly, there\\'s no way to rotate it with the default controls, so you\\'ll need to practice flying it from all angles, which is at some times quite confusing if you aren\\'t flying with your forward matching the drone\\'s forward.<br /><br />Now for my only complaints. The batteries can\\'t even come close to keeping up with me. I like to fly very fast, high, and aggressive, which means my first trip to the park with two fully charged batteries lasted just under an hour. I even brought my USB power bank and charged the first dead battery while using the second battery, so I got another half a charge from the first battery after the second one died.<br /><br />The last thing to note is wind factor. With how light this is, it is VERY susceptible to wind. It was only slightly windy in my first use at the park, but it heavily affected my flying. Even going full speed towards the wind, it can\\'t always power through it and will end up flying away. This becomes more true the higher in the air you go.<br /><br />Luckily, whether you\\'re fighting against strong wind or your own incompetence, the drone has some greatauto-balancing techniques that greatly aid in self-recovery (when it senses it\\'s tilting too far in a direction). I had a lot of fun going really high up, cutting all power, watching it free fall, then go full power again and watch it recover just before hitting the ground. Do at your own risk though, of course!<br /><br />So my final word on this is: FUN!

It\\'s great for teaching shapes, colors and words. My son used to love this when he was into the chunky puzzles and for a while I remember he would find shapes around the house (doors and cabinets = rectangles, light fixtures = circles, mirrors = squares, etc) constantly name them. I was amazed that he could really tell the difference between a rectangle and a square (he was about 15-18 mos) and that the heart and star are his favorite shapes. He would even find the smallest things and notice their shapes...like that an eraser and the buds of daisies are round. With this puzzle he also figured out that you could stack some of the shapes upright as long as they had a flat side. If he couldn\\'t stack them upright he would lie them flat and we would do kaleidoscope-ish designs.

       " '\"We received these water balloons by Balloon Monsoon to review. I thought this would be the perfect activity to do with my kids for “Fun Friday” especially since it is sooo hot where we live. People say summer is over, but I have to tell you, here in Arizona, it feels like summer all year long! Having a water balloon fight is just what the kids ask for when they are begging to cool off! However, often times, tying the water balloons and making sure you have enough to have fun is just not worth the extra work! Until I came across Balloon Monsoon! With Balloon Monsoon, it is a self-tying kit that allows you to easily fill the balloons with water and tie them efficiently. You simply fill a big tub with a few inches of water, and attach a hose to the end of the wands, and allow the balloons to fill with water. They automatically fall off the wands once full, and don’t require any tying by you! How simple is that, right? Since we home school our kids, we have set aside Fridays for a “Fun Friday”. This was the perfect activity, and the kids (and hubby) LOVED it! Everyone had an absolute blast! I would definitely recommend this water balloon set, especially since it really saves you time from filling tons of water balloons. It’s quick, easy, and super-efficient!! They also have a refill set that provided plenty of balloon and ties so if you run out, you can still continue the fun in the sun for several days!! Note: I received this Balloon Monsoon for free in exchange for my honest review. However, opinions expressed in this review are 100% my own.\"\\n',\n",

The one I received came in Federation gray, not the white in the picture. Only con I can think of is that some of the led\\'s in one nacelle are considerably dimmer than the other two nacelles. Very minor.

       " '\"We have been doing the Elf on the Shelf tradition for several years now but now that we have 3 kids, we were one Elf short so it was time to add another to the family (and of course, we couldn\\'t resist the bonus reindeer!)! The Elf on the Shelf sets are extremely well-made and very well thought out. They will hold up for years and this is easily something that could be passed down to your children (so they can torment, I mean, delight! their children! :)), since these aren\\'t meant to be played with - not by the kids anyhow! ;) This set comes in a very nice presentation box that says &#34;A Very Special Gift from Santa&#34; on the box (Amazon is nice enough to double box this though so no worries about kids seeing it before they are supposed to!). You get a blue-eyed girl elf with her own hardcover book all packaged in a nice presentation box. I was a little disappointed that her skirt was not included, especially since it is pictured in the book, but it wasn\\'t a deal-breaker for me. Just be aware that you have to buy it separate if that is something you want to get. The reindeer is completely new to me and I don\\'t think the &#34;elf pets&#34; even existed before this year. He is absolutely ADORABLE and very well-made and his presentation box (aka &#34;stable&#34;) is really cute! He also comes with a hardcover book, which was a nice surprise! I know the Elf on a Shelf gets a lot of criticism, and yes, it is kind of a pain in the butt to move the darn things every night, but it is SO worth it when you watch your kids run around the house with excitement looking for those elves and seeing their eyes light up when they discover what mischief their elf had been up to the night before! You can get a TON of ideas for what to do with your Elf on Pinterest! One of our favorites is creating an elf &#34;zipline&#34; and running a thin ribbon from room-to-room and having the elves hang from it! Ours have also ended up in a bowl of marshmallows, they have made elf &#34;donuts&#34; with cheerios, frosting and sprinkles, they write messages on the mirror with lipstick or liquid chalk markers, they have made &#34;snow-angels&#34; on the counter with powdered sugar, they have hid out in our fridge and turned our milk green, the list goes on and on! There are so many FUN ways to get your child excited about Christmas and the idea that the elf will report back to Santa regarding the naughty or nice status each night doesn\\'t hurt, either! :) I really like having multiple elves in our home because it allows you to come up with creative ways for them to interact with each other and it really expands the stories you can tell with these little guys (and girls!)!

The details on this figure are precise and accurate. It\\'s a bit larger than some of the other figures, but just as well made. Schleich dinosaurs are also tough.

       " '\"I gave this to my daughter for her fist birthday (in natural.) This is not appropriate for a one year old if they are not already walking. She is four now and still uses her doll pram almost everyday. I have two neices ages four and two and they bring the doll pram out to play every time they come over too. This doll pram is beautiful and so well made! I absolutely love the heart window on both sides of the pram. These doll prams are a little expensive but when things are made completely out of wood and so well done they will last for generations making it worth every penny. The doll pram is much smaller than expected so make sure you look at the other picture with the little girl walking outside with it for reference and check the specs. I wasn\\'t fond of the red pram when my older daughter was one (it looks very 70\\'s to me because of the mustard colored wheels) but when my younger daughter turned one and I was looking for a special birthday present for her I came back to order another. I ended up ordering the red because I didn\\'t want their prams to be identical and I love it! The red is like a dark cherry red (not quite as bright as the picture imo) and I think the yellow wheels add character. I have not had any issues with either pram. The only thing I noticed between the two prams is now the handle bar is not one solid piece of wood. On the first natural pram purchased four years ago the handle bar is one solid piece with tapered ends now the newer red pram has tapered ends with large slits on the sides. I don\\'t know why they changed it and it\\'s not really as big deal but I notice it and I don\\'t think it\\'s as aesthetically pleasing. It is such a minor thing because the overall look of the pram is darling but I like the older handle bar. The inside of the stroller is open so there is not a raised &#34;bed&#34; inside for the doll to lay flat, instead the doll sits all the way at the bottom of the stroller in the curve. This is also not a big deal, more space to load up the stroller with stuff, but when there is only a baby doll in there she is far away/ low to the ground. Moover does sell bedding for this pram that has a cushion to sit at the bottom of the pram and elevate the baby doll, but it is also pricey and I have not purchased it.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Oh boy. I was looking forward to this product, and while it\\'s far from perfect, it delivered in a lot of ways.<br /><br />-The size. This thing is big! The rear portion is large enough to be comfortably used like a stock. The pistol grip is also pretty large to accommodate the magazines, and it\\'s quite a nice change.<br /><br />-The spring. This thing takes a good bit of heft to work the lever (positioning could be better), but it\\'s mighty satisfying to rack this thing.<br /><br />-The ranges and accuracy. The foam balls don\\'t quite carry their velocity as well over ranges compared to the original darts, but they fly much straighter due to, A.) What looks like a bit of backspin applied, and, B.) No fishtailing from the awkward aerodynamics of elite darts sending them all over the place.<br /><br />-The sound! It\\'s like hitting a tennis ball with a metal pan! Equal parts intimidating and annoying as hell.<br /><br />-The magazine. It works great! Easy to loud rounds into, easy to load and eject. Very simple, I doubt we\\'ll see any changes to it.<br /><br />Two negatives to note real quick though:<br /><br />-Inconsistencies with weight on the foam balls are likely the reason behind some inconsistencies with accuracy. Hopefully Hasbro gets this sorted out, but at least they work well enough for now, and are still better than elite darts in that regard.<br /><br />-A bit prone to jamming. No issues if you smoothly work the action, but the heavy spring and somewhat rigid gear system for the plunger make it tough to avoid. Haven\\'t had anything beyond an awkward double feed that I managed to clear, and the foam balls are much less eager to shred and clog things up like darts do, but it\\'s a known issue that apparently Hasbro plans to address down the line with a revision, so it might be worth waiting a bit for that.<br /><br />Still, it\\'s great fun for the price, they definitely succeeded in building a product for the older audience. Hopefully this line sticks around, I can\\'t wait to see where they take it in the future.\"\\n',\n",

It does not seem to transform, but it is still awesome to behold.<br /><br />As the pictures show, it arrives encased in a clear, sturdy plastic with a backdrop scene from rioting in Gotham City. The magazine itself is only 10 pages, not 12. The interior opens up, providing us with a diagram that breaks down the genetic makeup of Rocksteady\\'s Batmobile. It becomes quite clear, if it wasn\\'t before, just how much thought went into making Rocksteady\\'s visionary dream of the Batmobile an outstanding reality.

       " '\"I purchased this by mistake, thinking it was the Revotech figure, so I was a bit bummed when I realized that I accidentally ordered a model kit. But I figured since I paid for him, I might as well put him together. The second I opened the box, all feelings of being bummed out disappeared. :) When I saw that he was actually chrome gold instead of a flat gold paint, I was a lot happier. ^_^ So I put him together, and I just him! :)<br />Now, this is a model kit, so naturally you\\'ll need to assemble it yourself. It\\'s a plastic snap together model, so you won\\'t need any screwdrivers or glue. On tool that I would recommend having is a set of pliers to help you get the pieces out. You can do it without pliers, but having pliers makes things easier. He has a few stickers that you need to apply, but they\\'re pretty easy to apply compared to some of the other Star Wars 1/12 models by Bandai that I\\'ve seen. He has a lot of pieces, so it may take a while to put him together depending on how much experience you have putting these together. I don\\'t buy model kits very often, so this took me a couple of hours to complete (feel free to laugh). All assembled, this model looks amazing! :) The chrome gold really gives him that authentic golden droid look, and he has some really nice details, too. :)<br />In terms of poseability, he has several points of articulation. His neck is on a ball joint, so he move his head in all directions. His shoulders are also ball joined, so you can rotate his arms around. The arms also swivel, too. :) He has two sets of arms; one set that bends at the elbow, and one set that doesn\\'t. For his hands, they peg into place, so you can rotate them, but that\\'s all the movement you get out of the hands. His torso and hips are connected by two ball joints, so you can rotate and bend the torso some. The torso bends back pretty well, but it doesn\\'t bend too far forward because of part of his torso piece. His legs do swivel, but they don\\'t really bend, so you can\\'t put him in a sitting position. His knees do bend some, but not all the way. As for his feet, they do swivel, but that\\'s about it for his feet.<br />He comes with some different pieces so that you can customize him a bit. He comes with two face pieces; one that\\'s dented, and one that\\'s normal. He also comes two different torso pieces; one that has the restraining bolt on it, and one that doesn\\'t. He also includes two sets of arms; one set that bends at the elbow (this set requires some extra assembly), and one set that doesn\\'t. He also comes with a couple of different sets of hands; one set that\\'s relaxed, and one set posed to hold a comlink. He also includes a comlink, but it\\'s very small, and very easy to lose if you aren\\'t careful. He also includes a dangling eye piece (you know, in the event that your favorite Star Wars memory is his eye hanging from its socket :D). The last thing he comes with is a base for him to stand on. :)<br />All in all, this is a fantastic model, and displays beautifully. :) We haven\\'t gotten word on if Hasbro plans to ever release a 6&#34; Black Series C-3PO figure, but this model kit makes a pretty substitute. :) If you have the time and patience to put him together, then I highly recommend him. :) He just looks fantastic, and makes a great addition to any collection. ^_^put him in a sitting position.

       " '\"These things are the shizznits... fo real.  We went rafting in Lawless Laughlin and had a blast !  Highly recommended watch out for jet skiiers and sometimes you might need them to tow you out but it\\'s the best time you can have ever !  They easily connect and are pretty tough - I mean I wouldn\\'t chance going down hardcore rocks, rapids, or waterfalls, but they are tough enough to bump rocks and not be phased at all.  They have cupholders and you can even blow them up manually if needed we did !  But make sure you use proper technique when doing so.  This was for a friends\\' bday and honestly it was the best one ever these came just in time to make the day all that it was - these are going to be heavily used.\"\\n',\n",

As of writing this review I have used it in not windy to windy conditions and everytime, it flies. Even without the manual or instructions, its pretty easy to learn and understand how to use the kite. It is also durable, it landed on its tip a few time when my kid cousins use it and it is still working fine. I highly recommend this kite!<br /><br />Just check the video for more details, if you have problem viewing the video check it out at https://youtu.be/SAKTjWnO520<br /><br />Sorry for the wind in the video, its quite windy, Actually while I was doing the video the wind varies from windy to not...\"\\n',\n",

       " \"Excellent drone with great HD video. And as many of these reviews state. It's been virtually indistuctable so far. There is also great distance with the drone. Don't hasitate to buy at this price point. The only damage I incurred was when I flew in (accidentally) into a steel street lamp at full speed. Otherwise. I've crashed it more times that I can count and not a problem. Crashed it only because I've been crazy with flying it' NOT because it's hard to control. Just I've been a daredevil while flying it.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Adorable! This Alphabet Magnetibook seems very appropriate for my 4-year-old grandson who is just learning his letters and site words.  Juratoys has many versions, all very cute and entertaining.  I bought several versions for my grandchildren who travel a lot to visit family. It\\'s great for quiet play in the airport, on the airplane, or even a long trip in the mini van. It fits on their laps so it helps them contain their play to \\'their own space\\' and all the pieces are carried inside the book. This is nice alternative to playing on the i-pad all the time.  Note: My only slight criticism is that the books do not latch or tie closed; I envision one of the kids spilling the pieces all over the airport - luckily that hasn\\'t happened...but it\\'s probably just a matter of time (smile). If used as a travel toy, I recommend finding a large rubber band to keep the book securely closed.so as not to lose pieces.\"\\n',\n",
